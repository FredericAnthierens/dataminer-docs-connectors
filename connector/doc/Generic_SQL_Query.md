## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## How to use

On the **Configuration** page, configure the **Server**, **Server Port**, **Database**, **SQL User** and **SQL Password** parameters in order to allow the connector to establish the connection.

The **SQL Connection State** parameter provides information about the current database connection state, while the **Execute State** provides more descriptive information about the connection state and query execution states.

If you intend to run a single query manually, you can configure the **SQL Query File Name** with the full file path to the file containing the query information.

You can also configure periodic queries in the **Queries** table, available on the **Queries** page.

The right-click menu of the table contains the following options:

- **Add Query**: Allows you to add a query by providing the Query Statement and the polling interval.
- **Delete Query**: Deletes the selected query from the table. You will need to confirm the deletion in a confirmation window.
- **Disable Query**: Disables the query polling, while keeping the query in the table.
