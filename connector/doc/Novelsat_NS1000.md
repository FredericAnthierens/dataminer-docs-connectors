# Novelsat NS1000

The NovelSat NS1000 Modulator delivers industry-leading data rates. A single unit covers the whole data range from 100 Kbps up to 365 Mbps using 70 Msym/sec transmission. The NS1000 features low bandwidth consumption, increasing satellite bandwidth efficiency by 30% to 60%, is highly versatile, with a single unit serving from 100 Kbps to 730 Mbps using existing bandwidth and has the smallest dish/HPA size, using the same data rates at remote locations.

## About

This SNMP connector can be used to monitor and configure the **Novelsat NS1000 Modulator** device.
