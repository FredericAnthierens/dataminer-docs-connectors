SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *private.*

## How to use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### Quick Config Page

Contains input and output configuration parameters, as well as Noise Reduction, Audio AES and Embedded Input Status, Ph.C and Loss Mode.

Page buttons provide access the **Input,** **Output A Standard**, and **Memory** subpages.

### General Page
