# MediaKind T1 Series

The T1 platform is a 2RU chassis that significantly reduces the rack and power consumption, processing more channels with a lower cost of ownership. It is equipped with 9 independent slots, dual fans, 2 hot swappable power supply modules and 2 hot swappable network switches. Each of the 9 slots can be fitted with high-performance Intel Xeon E3 processors designed to support advanced video processing, like Ericsson MediaFirst Video Processing Encoding Live.

## About

This connector displays the available chassis information. It uses an SNMP and HTTP API connection to get information about nodes, servers, power supplies, fans and the general chassis status.

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device (default: *ByPassProxy*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### HTTP httpConnection Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

On the **API** **Setting** page, specify the username and password to connect to the API.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
