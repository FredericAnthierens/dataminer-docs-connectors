# Cisco NSO

## About

The Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) is an orchestration platform for hybrid networks. It provides comprehensive lifecycle service automation to enable you to design and deliver high-quality services faster and more easily.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

When you have created the element, go to the **General** page and specify the login credentials so the connector can communicate with the Cisco NSO.

## How to use

On the **General** page, the login credentials should be specified to establish communication with the device.

On the **Details** page, the Check IPTV details table shows information for each IPTV provider, such as the Primary Site, the Primary Device, the Secondary Site, and the Last Primary Site Change timestamp.
