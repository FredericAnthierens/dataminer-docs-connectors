# Ciena Blue Planet Operate

## About

This is a DataMiner connector for the **Ciena Blue Planet Operate**, a network management system designed to manage Ciena devices. With this connector, you can monitor the Ciena device data with DataMiner's alarm monitoring and trending features. Each device can be displayed as a **Dynamic Virtual Element** (DVE) in the DataMiner user interface, for more intuitive monitoring.

### Key Features

- **Alarm monitoring of the devices**: Every alarm triggered from the devices can be monitored in real time.
- **Dynamic Virtual Element (DVE) configuration**: Every device within the network management system can be represented as a DVE.

## Use Cases

### Node Device Alarms Monitoring

**Challenge**: The **Ciena Blue Planet Operate** has alarms coming from many devices within its network. This might make it hard to monitor the alarms for each of the devices.

**Solution**: With this connector, you can easily represent the devices as a DVE, so that each device can be monitored individually.

**Benefit**: Potential issues can be quickly addressed in real time, improving the reliability and performance of managing the Ciena devices.

## Prerequisites

- An API Key and user ID are required for the connector's HTTP requests to work.
