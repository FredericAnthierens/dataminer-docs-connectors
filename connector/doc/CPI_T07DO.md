# CPI T07DO

## About  
The CPI T07DO is a rugged 750 W outdoor travelling-wave-tube (TWT) amplifier designed for high-performance satellite uplink applications. With this connector, you can integrate the amplifier into your DataMiner system, enabling real-time monitoring, control and diagnostics across your teleport or ground-station infrastructure.

## Key Features  
- **High-power outdoor amplifier support**: Monitor and control a 750 W TWT amplifier in hostile outdoor environments, directly from DataMiner.  
- **DBS-band uplink footprint**: Optimised for the 17.3-18.4 GHz band, ideal for satellite service providers and teleport operators.  
- **Seamless network integration**: Use serial over TCP/IP and CAN-bus interfaces to bring amplifier data into your unified operations platform.  
- **Remote analytics & diagnostics**: Retrieve log entries, set alarms and thresholds, view performance trends — all in one place.  
- **Fleet-wide visibility & automation**: Integrate amplifier health into signal-path and service-assurance workflows to reduce downtime and boost reliability.

## Use Cases  
### Use Case 1  
**Challenge**: Teleport operators struggle with scattered outdoor amplifiers, each requiring local access and manual monitoring.  
**Solution**: The CPI T07DO connector lets you bring these amplifiers into your DataMiner system for remote management.  
**Benefit**: Centralised oversight, lower site-visit costs and faster fault resolution.

### Use Case 2  
**Challenge**: Mobile or deployable uplink terminals need reliable high-power amplification in harsh conditions.  
**Solution**: Monitor the CPI T07DO’s key metrics and alarms remotely even when deployed in the field.  
**Benefit**: Enhanced uptime, remote diagnostics and reduced logistical overhead.

### Use Case 3  
**Challenge**: Service assurance teams need visibility of uplink amplifier health to correlate with overall signal path performance.  
**Solution**: Feed CPI T07DO telemetry and alarms into DataMiner dashboards and integrate it into your end-to-end monitoring workflows.  
**Benefit**: Improved service-quality tracking, proactive maintenance and fewer unexpected downtime events.

## Technical Reference
