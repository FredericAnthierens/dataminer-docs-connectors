# CPI T07DO

## About

The CPI T07DO is a rugged 750 W outdoor traveling-wave-tube (TWT) amplifier designed for high-performance satellite uplink applications. With this connector, you can integrate the amplifier into your DataMiner System, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and diagnostics across your teleport or ground-station infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **High-power outdoor amplifier support**: Monitor and control a 750 W TWT amplifier in hostile outdoor environments, directly from DataMiner.
- **DBS-band uplink footprint**: Optimized for the 17.3-18.4 GHz band, ideal for satellite service providers and teleport operators.
- **Seamless network integration**: Use serial over TCP/IP and CAN-bus interfaces to bring amplifier data into your unified operations platform.
- **Remote analytics & diagnostics**: Retrieve log entries, set alarms and thresholds, view performance trends â€” all in one place.
- **Fleet-wide visibility & automation**: Integrate amplifier health into signal-path and service-assurance workflows to reduce downtime and boost reliability.

## Use Cases

### Remote Management of Amplifiers

**Challenge**: Teleport operators struggle with scattered outdoor amplifiers, each requiring local access and manual monitoring.

**Solution**: The CPI T07DO connector lets you bring these amplifiers into your DataMiner System for remote management.

**Benefit**: Centralized oversight, lower site-visit costs and faster fault resolution.

### Remote Monitoring of Key Metrics and Alarms

**Challenge**: Mobile or deployable uplink terminals need reliable high-power amplification in harsh conditions.

**Solution**: Monitor the CPI T07DO's key metrics and alarms remotely even when deployed in the field.

**Benefit**: Enhanced uptime, remote diagnostics and reduced logistical overhead.

### Amplifier Health Integrated in End-to-End Monitoring Workflows

**Challenge**: Service assurance teams need visibility on uplink amplifier health to correlate with overall signal path performance.

**Solution**: Feed CPI T07DO telemetry and alarms into DataMiner dashboards and integrate them into your end-to-end monitoring workflows.

**Benefit**: Improved service-quality tracking, proactive maintenance, and fewer unexpected downtime events.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner 10.3.0** or higher.
- **Appropriate firmware version** on the amplifier unit (as defined in the technical documentation).
