# Evertz BPXRF

## About

This connector monitors the input and output of different Evertz cards inside a single chassis. The following cards are supported:

- Evertz 7703PA
- Evertz 7703BPX

15 slots are available, which means that 14 cards can be added. Slot zero is reserved for the frame carrier.

Data is polled via SNMP.

## Key Features

- **Monitor and control both BPXRF and 7703PA cards**: You can use this one connector to monitor both Evertz BPXRF and Evertz 7703-PA cards.
- **View and configure faults**: With multiple fault statuses across both cards, you can easily monitor and control various fault types.

## Use Case

- **Challenge**: Multiple BPXRF/7703PA cards under one frame need to be monitored.
- **Solution**: Monitor both types of cards with the Evertz BPXRF connector.
- **Benefit**: Dynamic virtual elements can be exported for separate monitoring of each card, all with this same connector.
