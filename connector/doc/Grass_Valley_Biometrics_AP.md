# Grass Valley Biometrics AP

## About

The Grass Valley Biometrics AP is part of GV's Media Assurance platform, using Media Biometrics. There is a device in the network that generates Biometric data for a piece of media that the AP (Assurance Point) will then use to compare with the media. This device communicates asynchronously using the Rollcall protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> The device must be able to provide the service LongStr.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *2050*).

  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

    - Range 1.0.0.x: The format is equal to *UU.PP*, where UU is the unit address and PP is the unit port. For example: *01.01*.
    - Range 1.0.1.x: The format is equal to *NNNN.UU.PP*, where NNNN is the unit network address, UU is the unit address and PP is the unit port. For example: *1160.01.01*.

## How to use

The element has two main functions: **configuration** and **logging**.

You can configure the general audio and device settings, the audio mapping, thresholds, and licenses associated with the device.

Logging is available for the device, audio, video and captions.
