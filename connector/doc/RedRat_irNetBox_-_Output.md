## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector is used by DVEs that are **automatically created** by the parent element. No user input is required.

## Usage

### General

On this page, you can **select which device is connected** via a drop-down menu that contains all custom device names. When you select a device, the **command drop-down menu is automatically updated** with all the commands for the specific device. When you **select a command** from the drop-down menu, that command is **directly sent to the irNetBox**.

You can also **select the corresponding Device Channel List** via a drop-down menu that contains all device list names. When you select a channel list, the **channel drop-down menu is automatically updated** with all the channels for the specific list. When you **click the Send button**, the protocol will **send the channel number** from the selected channel **to the IR output of the irNetBox** with the correct commands for the device that is connected to the output. If you press a button for an output for which no device is selected, you will be notified with a message.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.1.x** connector range of the **RedRat irNetBox - Output** connector supports the usage of DCF.

Note that DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

Connectivity for this protocol is managed by the parent protocol **RedRat irNetBox**.
