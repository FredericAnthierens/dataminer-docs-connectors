# Novella Satcoms B356

## About

The **Novella Satcoms B356** tracking receiver is designed to track and measure pilots or beacons of all known commercial and military satellites. It is particularly suited to track satellite beacons (frequency and power stable signals generated on board satellites, used for telemetry and control) in earth stations using large antennae requiring good boresight alignment and stable uplink power. The tracking receiver has an input at L-band, 940 MHz to 2,150 MHz. The L-band signals are downconverted to around 70 MHz and then processed by a coherent tracking and detection module. The tracking module uses a 2 kHz PLL for signal acquisition and level measurement by coherent detection.
