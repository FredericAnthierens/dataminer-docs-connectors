# Nevion CP524

The CP524 TS adapter is designed to meet the requirements of operators and service providers for flexible repacking and delivery of content for multiple end points.

Its multi-stream (any input to any output) filtering/remultiplexing features enable operators and service providers to save valuable bandwidth in their networks.

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Virtual fixed interfaces:

- **VirtMUX**: All physical interfaces that are used for input and not connected to a soft switch are connected through this interface, which is of type **inout**. All soft switches are connected through this interface as well.

Physical fixed interfaces:

- **ASI1**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI2**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI3**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI4**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI5**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI6**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI7**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **ASI8**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.
- **Eth1**: Physical RJ45 interface with type **inout**.
- **Eth2**: Physical RJ45 interface with type **inout**.
- **Eth3**: Physical RJ45 interface with type **inout**.
- **RefIn**: Physical ASI interface with type **inout**.

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- **VirtTS**: All transport streams are represented by an interface, linked with the **Output Table**. All these interfaces are of type **inout**.
- **VirtSS**: All soft switches are represented by an interface, linked with the **Input Switches** **Table**. All these interfaces are of type **inout**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- If in the **Physical Ports Table** the value for the **Output/Input Select** is **Input** (-1) and the ASI port is not connected to a **VirtSS** interface, for all ASI ports that are used as input, an internal connection is created between that **ASIx** interface and the **VirtMUX.**
- For all available **VirtSS** interfaces, an internal connection is created between the **VirtSS** interface and the **VirtMUX**.
- If, in the **TS IP Input RX** **Table**, the **Interface Name** contains **ethx**, for all Ethernet ports that are used as input, an internal connection is created between that **Ethx** interface and the **VirtMUX**.
- If the TS is in the **Output Table**, an internal connection is created between the **VirtMUX** and all the transport streams from the **VirtTS**.
- If in the **Physical Ports Table** the value for the **Output/Input Select** is TS x **Output** (9, 10, 11 or 12) and in the **TS IP Output TX** **Table** the **Interface Name** contains **ethx**, an internal connection is created between the interfaces from **VirtTS** and all the ports that are used as output for the transport stream.
