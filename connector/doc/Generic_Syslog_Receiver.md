# Generic Syslog Receiver

## About

The Generic Syslog Receiver is a DataMiner connector dedicated to capturing, consolidating, and analyzing information received via Syslog messages. It functions as a central listening post, gathering critical operational and security data sent from one or more network devices across the infrastructure. The connector processes these raw messages and extracts severity, enables filtering, triggers alarms, and writes Syslog messages to files.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source Syslog centralization**: Listens via a smart-serial connection to capture from multiple network devices.

- **Syslog message display**: Automatically processes incoming Syslog messages and displays their data along with associated severity levels.

- **Filtering and search**: Provides tools to filter the overview of incoming messages based on message severity or specific data content within the message text.

- **Alarm triggering**: Allows you to define specific criteria (based on message content) to trigger DataMiner alarms immediately when critical events occur.

- **Historical logging**: Includes the capability to write all incoming Syslog messages directly to local log files.

## Use Cases

### Centralized Monitoring

**Challenge**: Manually checking Syslog messages across different device types for events is time-consuming and often leads to delayed response times.

**Solution**: The Generic Syslog Receiver acts as a single, dedicated endpoint, instantly capturing and centralizing all Syslog messages in a table, where they can be categorized by severity.

**Benefit**: Provides a unified, real-time overview of event logs across the entire network, drastically reducing the time required to detect and respond to anomalies.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

Make sure the network device sending the messages is configured to forward Syslog messages to the DataMiner element.
