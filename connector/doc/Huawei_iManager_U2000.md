# Huawei iManager U2000

The **Huawei iManager U2000** connector communicates with a Huawei iManager U2000 device to gather information about all **managed elements** in the network and the **links** between them.

## About

**HTTP SOAP** calls are used to retrieve all information.

This connector will create **dynamic virtual elements** for each managed element in the Huawei network.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### HTTP Main connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Configuration

The **username** and **password** need to be configured on the Configuration page.

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information about the Huawei iManager U2000 and allows you to initiate actions such as:

- **Refreshing all data** (note that this can take some time depending on the size of the network).
- **Removing all missing data**.
- **Automatically arranging the managed elements** for the Visio image of the main element.
- **Updating DCF** (note that you should make sure all data is up to date, as otherwise connections and connection properties could be removed)

Buttons to initiate an update of a single type of data can be found on the corresponding page.

### Treeview

This page displays a tree view starting from the resource sites.

The following data is available in the tree view:

- **Resource Sites**
- **Managed elements**
- **Shelves**
- **Slots**
- **Equipment**
- **Physical Termination Points**
- **Floating Termination Points**
- **Cross Connections**

### Elements

This page displays all **managed elements** in a table with some additional information.

**DVEs** are created based on this table.

### Equipment

This page displays all **shelves**, **slots** and **equipment** with their name and state.

### Termination Points

This page displays all **Physical Termination Points** and **Floating Termination Points**.

### Cross Connections

This page displays all **Cross Connections** with some information.

### Topological Links

This page displays all **Topological Links** of the Huawei network.

### Resource Sites

This page displays all **Resource Sites** with their name and type.

### Sub Network Connections

This page displays all **Sub Network Connections** (**services**) in a table.

### Configuration

The **username** and **password** need to be configured on this page in order to communicate with the Huawei iManager U2000 device.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The 1.0.0.x connector range of the Huawei iManager U2000 connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

Connectivity for all exported connectors is managed by this connector.

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- For each entry in the **Floating Termination Points Table**, an interface is created. These interfaces are inout.

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- For each entry in the **Physical Termination Points Table**, an interface is created. These interfaces are inout.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- For each **Cross Connection**, an internal connection is created with the following properties:

- If the connection is used in 1 or multiple services, connection property **Service** of type **generic** is added with a semicolon-separated list of the **service names** as value.

#### External Connections

- For each **Topological Link**, an external connection is created.

## Notes

The connector does not allow the user to configure anything on the device. Only requesting information is supported.

The connector does not support multiple management domains.

**Custom Visio files** are available for the main element and the DVEs.
The Visio image for the **main element** displays all managed elements and connects them with DCF.
The **DVE** Visio image displays the shelf overview. **Multiple shelves** will be displayed on different pages.
Currently the following types of shelves are supported:

- **OptiX OSN 8800 T32**
- **OptiX OSN 8800 T16**
- **OptiX OSN 6800**
- **OptiX OSN 3500**
