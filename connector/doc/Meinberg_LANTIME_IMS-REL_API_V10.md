# Meinberg LANTIME IMS-REL API V10

The **REL** error relay module can be switched by various operating states (e.g. Clock Not Sync). If the internal hardware clock is synchronous to the source, the relay is switched to NO (Normally Open) mode.
In case of an error, the relay switches to NC (Normally Closed) mode.

Depending on the hardware configuration of the IMS system, e.g. redundant with RSC module and two integrated reference clocks, or with SPT module and only one reference clock, different relay states can be switched.

In redundant operation, the two clocks and the changeover unit are monitored by default (CLK1 - relay A, CLK2 - relay B, RSC - relay C). Optionally, other signals can also be monitored (10 MHz, PPS). The relays A + C can also be switched based on notifications (events).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Initialization

#### Slot ID

The DataMiner element will not know which slot it needs to represent until the slot ID has been provided.

On the **General** page, the **slot ID** must be configured.

#### REST API

The HTTP communication uses a REST API, which needs to be enabled.

On the device's web interface, make sure the **Enable REST API** option is selected under the **general settings** on the **System** page.

#### HTTP Credentials

The HTTP communication will not be up and running until the necessary HTTP credentials have been provided.

On the **Credentials** page of the element, the **user name** and **password** must be configured.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

REST (Representational State Transfer) calls are used to retrieve the device information.

### HTTP Communication

On the **HTTP Communication** page, you can track the HTTP sessions used for communicating with the device.

This makes it possible to follow the communication flow and provides some useful statistics, e.g. request time, response time, time span (RTT), etc.

- **HTTP Sessions State**: If you enable this setting, the active HTTP sessions will be tracked.
- **HTTP Sessions Max Count**: This determines the maximum number of HTTP sessions that will be tracked.
