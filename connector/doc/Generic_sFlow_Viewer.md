## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection to establish a connection with an **Elasticsearch database**.

## How to use

On the **General** page, the **Flow Logs Table** shows the persistent flow logs.

The **Poll** **button** obtains the persistent flow logs based on the filters and the information filled in in the **Flow Logs Table**.

Click the **Filters button** to open a page with the filter properties.

- Add \* to the start and/or end of the filter parameter value to specify that the value can have a possible prefix and/or suffix, respectively. This indicates that a wildcard is used for the filter parameter.
- The **Poll** **button** behaves the same way as the Poll button on the **General page**.
