# CISCO XROS Manager

## About

The CISCO XROS Manager connector interfaces with Cisco ASR Routers to collect network state and configuration information using the OpenConfig data models and gNMI. It enables standardized, vendor-agnostic telemetry and automation for real-time monitoring and network operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When gNMI is used to retrieve device information:
>
> - The Communication Gateway DxM must be installed on the DataMiner Agent.
> - You need to configure the connector to run with its own **SLProtocol** and **SLScripting** processes (see [Configuring separate SLProtocol and SLScripting instances for a specific protocol](https://aka.dataminer.services/configuring-separate-slprotocol-and-slscripting-instances)).
> - The number of elements for one DataMiner Agent must be limited to approximately 60.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

#### Configuration of Credentials for gNMI communication

On the **Element Settings** page, fill in the **gNMI settings** and click **Connect** to establish the gNMI communication.

Make sure to fill in the full address in the **gNMI IP Address** parameter, e.g. `https://x.x.x.x`. The **Client Certificate** parameter is optional.

## How to Use

### Communication Manager

On the **Communication Manager** page, under the **Element Settings**, you can configure how data is retrieved. This table is only visible to users with level 4 permissions.

You can configure the following settings to retrieve the underlying data paths:

- **Type: Poll**: Requires an interval to be specified. The connector will poll the data source at the defined interval.
- **Type: Subscribe with Interval**: Creates a sampled subscription. The target system sends data updates once per specified interval. This method is commonly used for counters.
- **Type: Subscribe with Interval 0** or **Type: Subscribe (On Change)**: Creates an "On Change" subscription, which means that the connector receives data updates only when the value of a data item changes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Keeping the default settings is recommended, as these have been carefully optimized to ensure the best performance when retrieving data between the data source and DataMiner.
> - Data retrieved using these settings is **not** visible in the **Stream Viewer**.

### Other Pages

On the **System** page of this connector, you will find key system parameters, including CPU usage and process details.

In the **Platform** section, you will find dedicated pages for **PSU**, **Fan**, and **Temperature** monitoring, providing insight into the systemâ€™s hardware components.

The **Interfaces** section provides general interface details, performance counters, and transceiver information for comprehensive network port monitoring.

The **LLDP** page displays how devices are interconnected across the network.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.0.x** range of the CISCO XROS Manager connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through third-party DataMiner connectors (e.g. a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic interfaces

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- **Interfaces:** Physical interfaces, type **inout** (in/out/inout).
