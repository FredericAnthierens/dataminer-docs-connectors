# Ateme Pilot Manager

## About

The Ateme Pilot Manager provides comprehensive monitoring and control for Ateme products and solutions, whether deployed on-premises or in the cloud. It offers intuitive operational views for real-time monitoring and service delivery control, with automatic failure detection and recovery. This guarantees continuous delivery and minimal service disruption. At present, Ateme Pilot Manager supports Titan Live, Titan Edge and Titan Mux products.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - Main

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

On the first startup, to initialize the element, you need to specify the following input configuration on the **General** page of the element:

- **PMF Deployment Name**: Pilot Manager Foundations portal deployment name to be used to construct the API URL.
- **PMS Deployment Name**: Pilot Manager Supervision deployment name to be used to construct the API URL.
- **Username**: Name of the user used in the HTTP login operation.
- **Password**: Password of the user used in the HTTP login operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To identify the PMF and PMS, access the Pilot Manager portal webpage. In the URL, you can find the PMF and PMS before and after the word "applications" in the path, respectively. Example: `https://<IP>/<PMF>/applications/<PMS>`.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

### General

On this page, you should specify the PMF deployment name and PMS deployment name to enable the connector to construct the API URL.
