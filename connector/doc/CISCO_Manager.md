# CISCO Manager

With the CISCO Manager, it is possible to configure and monitor CISCO switches, for example the CISCO Catalyst 3750. Because multiple device types are supported, monitoring can be enabled or disabled for a specific type.

## About

The CISCO Manager connector can retrieve information from different device types. This makes it possible to limit the retrieval of parameter values to what is needed or available on the device at hand.
In addition to polling values, you can configure settings such as the ping function as if doing so on the device itself.

## Configuration

### Enabling SNMPv3

As version range 4.1.1.x and 6.1.1.x use SNMPv3, extra settings are needed for these. The following steps must be executed before data can be retrieved.

1. In **System Display**, go to **Admin** \> **Elements**.

1. In the **Element List** header, click **Export**.

1. In the **Export** dialog box, select **All Element data** and **Save** as CSV file.

1. Open the CSV file and specify the additional settings for the SNMPv3 elements in the columns:

   - DataBits: Contains the username.

   - StopBits: Contains the security level. Possible values:

     - 0: NOAUTH_NOPRIV
     - 1: AUTH_NOPRIV
     - 2: AUTH_PRIV

   - Parity: Contains the authentication type. Possible values:

     - 0: NONE
     - 1: MD5
     - 2: SHA1

   - GetCommunity: Contains the authentication password.

   - FlowControl: Contains the privacy type. Possible values:

     - 0: NONE
     - 1: DES
     - 2: AES128

   - SetCommunity: Contains the privacy password.

1. **Save** the CSV file.

1. In the **Element List** header, click **Import**.

1. In the **Open dialog box**, select the CSV file and click **Open**.

Version range 2.1.x.x, 3.1.x.x, and 5.x.x.x do not require any extra settings.

### SNMP Polling

As this connector supports different types of devices, all polling of parameters is disabled by default. The needed parameter sections have to be explicitly enabled.
You can do so on the **General** page via the **SNMP Polling** page button.

### HTTP Polling

Some tables are not accessible through SNMP, so an interface was added in order to make some data available for display.

You cannot configure this interface during element creation; however, **you must configure the device's HTTP interface in the device CLI** in order for DataMiner to be able to access data via HTTP.
You also have to go to the **HTTP Polling** subpage of the **General** page and set up the connection with CLI **username**, **password**, **privilege level**, and **operation mode**. The connector will start polling HTTP data when the username and password are configured and when any of the toggle buttons present on the HTTP Polling page are set to "Enable".

### Enabling LITE Mode

You can enable LITE mode (only displaying part of the interface table) on the **General** page via the **SNMP Polling** page button.

### Polling Settings

Disabling **Interfaces Status** polling will stop sending "show interfaces status" SSH commands. As a result, the **Detailed Interface Info** table **IF Status** column will show *N/A* for every row.

Enabling Interfaces Status polling will instruct the connector to send a "show interfaces status" SSH command every time the Interface Table is polled. This means that **disabling Interface Table polling automatically disables Interfaces Status polling**. If no "show interfaces status" SSH command is sent even though Interfaces Status polling is enabled, check if Interface Table polling is enabled.

The Interfaces Status **polling interval** follows the Interface Table polling interval, no matter what is defined as the Interfaces Status polling interval. The Interface Table polling interval defines how frequently the "show interfaces status" SSH command is sent.

Interfaces Status polling will only succeed if the parameters **User Name** and **Password**, located on the **SSH Polling** page, are filled in correctly. If Interfaces Status polling fails, check the parameters **Connection Status** and **Status Message** on the SSH Polling page.

### Device Configuration

Because of the way SSH connections are created, we recommend limiting the SSH user for DataMiner to three concurrent connections. When the minimum supported version becomes 10.2.9, this configuration will no longer be needed.

## Usage

### General page

On the General page, an overview of general device settings is displayed, e.g. **Model**, **Software Description**, etc.

Multiple page buttons are also available that provide access to more specific information:

- **Memory Details**: When enabled, memory information will be shown in the table. Polling can be enabled or disabled.
- **TCP/UDP Stats**: When enabled, TCP/UDP information will be shown. Extra information can be found via the **UDP Listener Info** and **TCP Connection Table** page buttons. Polling can be enabled or disabled.
- **ICMP Stats**: When enabled*,* ICMP information will be shown. Polling can be enabled or disabled.
- **IP Stats**: When enabled, IP information will be shown. Polling can be enabled or disabled.
- **Services**: Displays whether a service layer is active or not.
- **VTP Info**: Displays VTP information. This can be loaded manually.
- **MAC Addresses**: Displays the MAC addresses. This must be loaded manually.
- **Copy config**: Allows you to define the CISCO Copy Configuration and start it.
- **Ping**: Allows you to define items for which the ping operation will be performed. The ping can be enabled or disabled.
- **Reset Counters**: Allows you to clear the interface counters of all ports or of specific ports.
- **Enable Polling**: Allows you to enable or disable multiple and/or different sections of parameters that need to be polled.

In addition, buttons are available that allow you to perform a **Redetect Config**, **Save Configuration**, or **Reset Device** operation.

Note: The **Chassis Model** and **Chassis Serial Number** parameters are linked with the table **Ent Physical Table**. Make sure to enable the table to make this information available.

### Detailed Interface Info page

The Detailed Interface Info page displays the interface info.

The column **IF Counter Type** displays if the bitrates are calculated with 32-bit or 64-bit counters. The bitrates are refreshed every 30s with the 32-bit counters. This is also the maximum allowed timespan to avoid a counter wraparound. With 64-bit, the bitrates are refreshed every minute to avoid drops to 0 Mbps for devices with a very high load.

**XMPL RPC** is an option to retrieve data that is not available on the CISCO device itself, e.g. **IF Speed** from a server. It will be retrieved via calls to a customized platform.

Via **Measurement Configuration**, you can enable or disable the display and calculation of the interface communication KPIs. Range 2.1.x.x uses subtables, which limits the polling (disabled rows are not polled). Range 3.1.x.x uses "multiplegetbulk", because when some cells were empty, the complete interface table was empty when polled with range 2.1.x.x. Multiplegetbulk does not support subtables, so disabled rows will still be polled.

- The **Enable All** button enables polling for all the interface communication KPIs.

- The **Disable All** button disables polling for all the interface communication KPIs.

- The **Enable Oper. Up** button enables polling for all interface communication KPIs with an *Up* operation state, and it disables all with a *Down* or *Admin Down* operation state.

- The **Keep and Enable Oper. Up** button enables polling for all interface communication KPIs with an *Up* operation state, and it disables all with an *Admin Down* operation state.

In the **3.1.1.x** and **4.1.1.x** ranges, you can temporarily activate the **high-resolution measuring** option, which triggers polling, calculating and updating interface-related KPIs with a frequency of **approximately 1 second**. You can enable this option and define the active time in the **MCT- High Resolution Measuring** and **MCT- High Res Active Time** columns of the **Measurement Configuration Table**, respectively.

More detailed information about the incoming and outgoing information can be found on the **Detailed Information Info - Rx** and **Detailed Information Info - Tx** pages.

The **History Data** page button (in range 3.1.0.x and 5.1.1.x) leads to an overview of the **Monthly traffic statistics.** These statistics are calculated each month. More detailed info (per day/week or month) can be found in the **Detailed Interface Info** table.

The **Alarm Settings** page displays the settings for consecutive and non-consecutive behavior on the interface utilization (%). With the **Threshold** you can specify a baseline in percent. The **Period** defines the amount of time that the threshold will be surpassed (consecutive) or the sum of the amounts of time that the threshold is surpassed (non-consecutive). The **Days** defines the number of days this behavior is active before an alarm is set. The alarm is set on **IF Util. Consecutive/Non-Consecutive** in the **Detailed Interface Info** table. With the **Status Period Alarms** toggle button, you can enable/disable this feature.

### Trunk Info page

On the **Trunk Info** page you can have the trunk ports table polled automatically by enabling **Get Trunk Data.** To request the table, just click the **Load** button once. The columns **Trunk Allowed** and **Trunk Pruning** will display the VLANs in the following formats:

- *All:* All VLANs are included.
- *None:* No VLANs are included.
- A range, e.g. *2,5,100-200*: VLAN 2 and VLAN 5 and VLANs 100 to 200 (including 200) are included.

There are several possibilities to change these columns (the explanation below focuses on **Trunk Allowed**; however, **Trunk Pruning** is similar):

- Write the correct format in the **Trunk Allowed** column.
- To add one VLAN to the current range (current VLANs will remain included), click the **Add Allowed Trunk** write parameter and fill in a VLAN.
- To remove one VLAN from the current range, click the **Remove Allowed Trunk** write parameter and fill in a VLAN.
- The page button **Modify Trunk** allows you to add a new entry to the trunk ports table or to edit an existing entry.

### Other pages

For each of the pages **PoE, ISDN, BGP, HSRP, LDP, OSPF, IGMP, IPSec, IPSLA, Vlan Info, IP Routing Info, Fan - PS Info, Chassis, Hardware Status, Temperature, Multicast, Multicast Next Hop, Ping Function** and **NBAR, Netflow, SHDSL**, and **XDSL**, polling can be enabled or disabled.

In the **3.1.1.x** and **4.1.1.x** ranges, you can use the **Measurement Configuration** functionality for **IP SLAs**.

### SCP (From version 3.1.1.81 onwards)

- SCP

  - **SCP Local Folder**: This parameter defines the path where the local folder should be created. This folder will contain the private keys and known host file.

  - **SCP Host**: This parameter defines the IP of the switch to connect to.

  - **SCP Port**: The port to be used for SCP connections.

  - **SCP Username**: The username used to login.

  - **SCP Password**: The password used to login.

  - **SCP Known Host File**: This parameter defines the name that should be given to the known host file, or the file that needs to be used. (If no file exists with the specified name, a new file with that name will be created.)

  - **Private Key File Name**: The name of the private key file to be used when authenticating the connection. **Note that to be able to use private key files, both the .ppk (used to connect with SCP) and .txt file (used to connect with Jsh) need to be present in the SCP Local Folder and have the same name.**

- Download

  - **Download Directory**: This parameter defines the directory where the downloaded files will be stored.

  - **Configuration File**: This parameter defines the possible configuration file to be downloaded from the device/switch.

  - **Download Status**: The status of the download process.

The **SCP functionality is only supported from DataMiner v9.5.3.0 - 6487 onwards**, as this relies on the SLSsh.dll library. When the connector is run on an older DMA, the log files will indicate a problem when DataMiner tries to build QAction 52000 and SCP will not work. This does not affect the rest of the connector.

### Voice-Dial (in 3.1.x.x range)

This page contains tables used for the management and configuration of voice telephony peers. In the 3.1.0.x range, it contains the **VoIP Peer Config** page button, which displays the **VoIP Peer Configuration Table**. In the 3.1.1.x range, the **VoIP Peer Configuration Table** is displayed on the main **Voice-Dial** page.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The 3.1.1.x, 4.1.1.x, and 5.1.1.x range of the CISCO Manager connector support the usage of DCF.

Different DCF configurations can be set on the DCF Config page.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- VLAN Info: virtual interfaces are created for **VLAN** connections, type inout.

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- DCF IF Table: physical interfaces are filtered from the **Detailed Interface Info** Table, type inout.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

On the DCF Config page, you can select 2 different sources for creating internal connections:

1. VLAN

   - Start Topology: For each VLAN, a virtual IF is created in the DCF table. The IFs are connected with their corresponding VLAN(s).

   - Full Mesh: The IFs are connected directly to each other. This can generate a lot of connections if a VLAN contains multiple IFs (n(n-1)/2 connections).

1. Multicast

   - Connections are created based on the multicast flows from the **Multicast Next Hop** table.

Between interfaces, an internal connection is created with the following properties (if enabled):

- **VLAN** connection property of type **inout** with value **VLAN ID**.
- **MC** connection property of type **inout** with value **Multicast IPs** (separated by ";").

## Notes

### CISCO Copy Configuration (Cisco IOS)

The configuration is stored in two locations, RAM and NVRAM. The running configuration is stored in RAM and is used during operation. Any configuration changes are made to the running configuration and take effect immediately. The startup configuration is stored in NVRAM and is loaded into the device's running configuration when booting. If the device loses power or is reloaded, changes to the running configuration will be lost unless they are saved to the startup configuration. The Cisco IOS is stored in FLASH memory. The IOS is the operating system controlling the device.
