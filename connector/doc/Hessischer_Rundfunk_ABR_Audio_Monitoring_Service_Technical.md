# Hessischer Rundfunk ABR Audio Monitoring Service

## About

The **ABR Audio Monitoring Service** connector is a customer-specific enhanced service protocol. When you create a service in DataMiner, you can use this service protocol to create an enhanced service that will monitor and aggregate the overall audio alarm status. The **Encoding Bitrate Status** and **Probe Download Status** are available as individual alarm status information in the service.

## Configuration

For more information on how to apply this service protocol to create an enhanced service element, see [Applying service template](https://aka.dataminer.services/applying-service-templates).

## How to use

You can find all the information you need to monitor the overall channel status on the General data page.

## Notes

This enhanced service protocol was designed for a specific project and is not expected to be reused in general.
