# Techex MWCore

The Techex MWCore connector is an **HTTP-based** connector that integrates the **Techex TXCore** product (formerly known as MWCore).

The Techex TXCore platform manages TXEdges (formerly known as MWEdge) and captures telemetry data for real-time monitoring.

This connector offers a monitoring and configuration interface for the **Techex TXCore Platform**. Through the REST API, it enables operations on monitored devices, channels, MWEdges, streams, sources, and outputs. Additionally, you can configure a **statistics connection** to provide telemetry data for sources and output sources, including **ETR290 statistics**.

Optionally, the connector can **export a DVE for each device** monitored by the Techex MWCore Platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use this connector, your DataMiner System must have an **indexing** database configured or use **STaaS**.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

This connection is used to perform the regular polling, to retrieve data from the device based on a request/response mechanism.

#### HTTP Secondary Connection (Prior to Range 1.0.4.x)

Prior to range 1.0.4.x, this connector also uses a redundant HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

> [!NOTE]
> This redundant connection is used for regular polling when the main connection fails. Starting from range 1.0.4.x, it is no longer in use. The 1.0.4.x range employs dynamic IPs and enables you to specify additional MWCore nodes within the same cluster in the Connections table.

### Initialization

In order to initialize the connector, you need to specify the following input configuration on the **General** page and **Statistics Configuration** subpage:

**HTTP Communication**:

- **Username:** Name of the user used in the HTTP login operation.
- **Password:** Password of the user used in the HTTP login operation.

**Statistics Configuration**:

- **Client Certificate Path:** Path to the .pfx client certificate. Note that the .pfx certificate file contains both public and private keys.
- **Client Certificate Password:** Password of the client certificate related to the referred path.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If the public and private key certificates are in the .pem format, they have to be exported to a .pfx file, as documented in [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/pkcs12.html) (e.g. openssl pkcs12 -inkey private_key.pem -in public_key.pem -export -out client_certificate.pfx).
> - *openssl.exe* comes alongside a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installation.

### Redundancy

From range 1.0.4.x onwards, a connections table is available on the General page, allowing you to specify additional TXCore nodes for DataMiner to automatically connect to if the primary connection becomes unavailable. The first entry is automatically added and always matches the one defined in the element editor.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

### DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Techex MWCore - Generic Device connector supports DCF usage. DCF can be implemented via the DataMiner DCF user interface and/or through DataMiner third-party connectors, such as a manager connector. This connector manages connectivity for all exported connectors.

**Interfaces type**: Virtual dynamic interfaces.

- **Output** interface: Created to interface with the DVE table with **interface type out**.

## How to use (range 1.0.4.x)

The Techex MWCore connector offers management and monitoring capabilities for the Techex TXCore Platform.

Configuration settings are retrieved through a polling mechanism that integrates with Techex's REST API (available at `<URL>/doc/`). Additionally, a socket connection can be established with each TXCore node to asynchronously receive telemetry data from the TXCore nodes about the attached TXEdges. This connection uses client-certificate authentication.

The Techex MWCore also integrates an [InterApp library](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-S-Techex_MWCore_ConnectorAPI), enabling a running element to communicate with other DataMiner elements and Automation scripts. This library supports CRUD actions for streams, sources, and outputs.

Below you can find more information about the different data pages available in the element.

### General

On this page, you should specify the username and password for connecting to TXCore during element initialization.

A connections table is available, allowing you to specify additional TXCore nodes for DataMiner to automatically connect to if the primary connection becomes unavailable. The active connection can be monitored via the Active Connection parameter.

In the connections table, the first entry (with priority 1) is automatically added and always matches the one defined in the element editor. You can edit a connection or force a specific connection to become active through the right-click menu of the table.

The state of the node address is monitored at 10-second intervals.

This page has several subpages:

- **Polling Configuration**: Allows you to define preferred polling settings, including the polling interval, edges to be polled, and fields to be retrieved. If the retrieved MWEdges list is empty, all edges will be polled simultaneously. Otherwise, a buffer mechanism is applied, and data for each edge will be polled individually.

- **Statistics Configuration**: Allows you to specify the connection settings for statistics/telemetry data processing. Note that the **Export to Logger Tables** feature is only available for DataMiner Systems that have an **indexing** database (Elasticsearch or OpenSearch).

- **Thumbnail Configuration**: Allows you to configure the desired settings for thumbnails retrieval. If thumbnails are needed for a low-code app, the path can be updated to `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\public\TechexMWCoreThumbnails`.

- **Debug**: Allows you to enable more detailed **logging** specifically for statistics data, generating new log files in the specified folder with a rolling window of 2 days and a file size of 10 MB. Files are generated in the following format: `{Protocol.ElementName}-statisticslog[{DnsName}].txt`. The **Statistics Buffer State** parameter indicates whether DataMiner is struggling to handle the volume and frequency of data being pushed by the TXCore. If there are difficulties, the parameter will display *Overflow*. For SRM integrations, you can enable the **SRM Information** parameter, making the SRM Resources page and its subpages visible in the element's data layout.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Telemetry data is sent to DataMiner asynchronously. To facilitate this, DataMiner establishes a dedicated connection with each TXCore node to receive the necessary telemetry data for streams, sources, and outputs. To prevent issues from excessive data and high frequency rates, the Techex MWCore DataMiner connector uses an **internal buffer** for message processing. This buffer can queue up to **300 messages**. Any message received after the queue is full will be dropped. If a message is dropped, the Statistics Buffer State parameter will display *Overflow*. The parameter will revert to the *Normal* state once the queue frees up approximately 50% and incoming messages can be successfully added to the queue again. The system waits for the queue to free up 20% to avoid the alarm toggling.

### Devices

The Devices page lists all devices monitored by TXCore. Here you can select whether DataMiner should create a DVE for each detected device. If DVEs are created, you can configure them on the Configuration subpage.

### Channels

On this page, you can view and monitor TXCore channels listed in the Channels table. Via the subpages, you can add or edit channels.

### MWEdges

The MWEdges page displays a table listing either all TXEdges or those specified on the Polling Configuration page. In this table, you can monitor the state of each edge, including addresses, licenses, the number of streams, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Bandwidth usage metrics (**source total**, **output total**, **total usage**, **license left**) are not retrieved through polling. Instead, DataMiner receives this data asynchronously via the statistics connections. Periodically, DataMiner performs the necessary calculations based on the values available in the sources and outputs tables. This feature is **disabled by default**. To enable it, navigate to the **General** > **Statistics Configuration** subpage and configure the **Total MWEdge Bitrate Calculation Interval** parameter.

The information for the monitored TXEdges is further detailed on the following subpages:

- **Streams**: Lists streams of all monitored TXEdges. You can add and delete streams via the right-click menu, and edit streams directly in the table columns. Using the right-click menu, you can also clear stats for all sources and outputs of the selected stream.

- **Sources**: Lists sources of all monitored TXEdges. You can add and delete sources via the right-click menu of the Sources table, and edit sources directly in the table columns. Using the right-click menu, you can also clear stats for selected source. In the Sources Statistics table, telemetry data is added when the statistics connection is enabled, such as bit rates, missing packets, and more.

- **Outputs**: Lists outputs of all monitored TXEdges. You can add and delete outputs via the right-click menu of the Outputs table, and edit outputs directly in the table columns. Using the right-click menu, you can also clear stats for selected output. In the Output Statistics and Output Listener Statistics tables, telemetry data is added when the statistics connection is enabled, such as bit rates, missing packets, and more.

- **ETR 290**: When the statistics connection is enabled, the table on this subpage lists ETR messages related to the sources.

- **Sources States**: The table on this subpage lists the source states (e.g. error caused by zero bitrate detected in the last 10 seconds). You can choose to include all sources or only the active ones.

- **Outputs States**: The table on this subpage lists the output states (e.g. error caused by an invalid passphrase). You can choose to include all outputs or only the active ones.

### Cluster Members

The Cluster Members page lists all nodes of the TXCore cluster. Here you can monitor the health of each node, including memory, CPU, and disk usage, as well as the number of devices and TXEdges connected to each TXCore node.

You can also enable the statistics interface from the table on this page and manually overwrite the IP address that DataMiner should use to open the statistics connection with the TXCore node by specifying the desired IP in the **Public IP Address** column.

If communication with a TXCore node fails more than a predefined number of times (monitored in the Retries column), the connection will be automatically disabled, and you will need to manually enable it again. You can configure the number of retries on the **General** > **Statistics Configuration** page.

Finally, the **Statistics Status** column displays the current status of the statistics connections (*OK*, *Timeout*, or *Warning*), indicating if any issues in the connection are being detected by DataMiner. The *Timeout* status indicates that DataMiner has not received any communication, including keep-alives, from the TXCore node for a period longer than the rate limit configured on the **General** > **Statistics page**. The *Warning* status indicates that DataMiner has not received valid telemetry information from the TXCore node for a period longer than three times the configured rate limit.

### SRM Resources

On the SRM Resources page and its subpages, you will find tables that can be linked to SRM solutions. These resource tables are categorized into streams, sources, outputs, and ports. Via the right-click menu, create, update, and delete actions are available.

These tables are linked to their respective counterparts that contain the data retrieved from TXCore.

This page is only visible if the **SRM Information** parameter is enabled on the **General** > **Debug** page.

### Web Interface

This page displays the TXCore web interface. The web interface is only accessible when the DataMiner host has network access to the TXCore platform.

## Known Issues

### DataMiner does not display statistics/telemetry

In most cases, this issue is related to the firewall or to the certificate.

To test the firewall rules, run the following command from the DataMiner host, replacing `<TXCore node ip>` by the IP address of the node that has to receive telemetry data and `<port>` with the port configured in TXCore for telemetry data (default: 7834):

```console
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <TXCore node ip> -Port <port>
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, DataMiner will use the IP address listed in the **IP Address** column of the **Servers Info** table, which is available on the **Cluster Members** page. Techex TXCore does not always provide the public IP of the node. If the IP provided by TXCore is not accessible from the DataMiner host, you can manually set the IP that DataMiner should use in the **Public IP Address** column of the same table.

After you have confirmed that the DataMiner host can reach and connect to the desired TXCore node on the specified telemetry port, try enabling the statistics connection for the specified node on the Cluster Members page.

If this fails, check the log file of the DataMiner element. If the issue is related to the certificate, a log message similar to the following should be present:

```console
2024/10/31 10:20:36.595|SLManagedScripting.exe|ManagedInterop|DBG|0|77|QA10000|FAILED: Processing Statistics Interface Notifications: System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The specified network password is not correct.

```

### Incorrect alarm description after switching from one stream to another

TXCore allows you to update an output by switching from one stream to another within the same TXEdge. However, if an alarm exists in DataMiner before this action, the alarm description may still display the original stream after switching. Nevertheless, any alarm actions, such as clearing and escalation, will be properly updated.
