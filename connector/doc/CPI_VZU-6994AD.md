## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The 1.1.1.x connector range of the CPI VZU-6994AD connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Physical fixed interfaces:

- Input (type in)

- Output (type out)

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- **Between the input and output**, an internal connection is created when the **operating state of the CMPA** is active. The connection is interrupted when the CMPA is in Standby or Beam Off Sequence.
