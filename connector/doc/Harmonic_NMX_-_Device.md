# Harmonic NMX - Device

This is an exported connector that displays information regarding the Harmonic NMX platform.

## About

The device information is retrieved via an SNMP connection and a serial connection. This connector is automatically generated by the parent connector Harmonic NMX, based on the information in its Platform table.

## Configuration

### Initialization

This connector is used by DVEs that are **automatically created** by the parent element. No user input is required.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page displays the general parameters.

- **In Service** allows you to place a device in or out of service.
- **Device Redundancy Group** shows which redundancy group the device is part of.
- **Device Redundancy State** shows if the device is a primary or backup device and if the device is in use or not.
- **Backup Took Over From** shows from which primary device the backup took over. This will only be filled in if the device is a backup device that is in use.
- The **redundancy parameters** only display the correct values if the **IsBackup** property is correctly defined on the Harmonic element.
- **Force Stream Polling** allows you to quickly refresh the input or output streams information of the device.

### Page Port

This page displays a table containing all port information for the element. It includes information such as **Network Group**, **Slot Name**, **Module Name**, **Port Name** and more. No settings can be configured on this page.

### Page Alarm

This page displays the alarm table for this element. This table contains all important information concerning the alarms, such as **Alarm Type**, **Site Name**, **Object Name**, **Severity**, **Time**, **IP Address**, etc.

### Page Device Service

This page provides an overview of all the services for this device.

The **Data Tables** page button provides access to the tables used in the **Stream Overview** tree control.

### Page Matrix

This page displays **which output is connected to which input** if the device is a matrix. For other devices (e.g. encoders), this table is empty.

### Page Stream Overview

This page displays a tree control that provides an overview of all **input and output streams and their services, PIDs and descriptors**. If you click an input stream, the parameter **Stream Active Channel** allows you to **switch between primary and backup**.

Note: It is not possible to define alarms on the tables included in this tree control, because a stream can be output for one device but also input for another device. In other words, rows of the base table can be exported to different DVEs and it is not possible to have one alarm that is linked to multiple elements.
