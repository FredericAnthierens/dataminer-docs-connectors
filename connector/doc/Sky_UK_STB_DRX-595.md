# Sky UK STB DRX-595

This connector can be used as a remote control for the Sky DRX-595 set-top box.

## About

This connector uses the RFB protocol for **serial** communication and the UPnP interface for **HTTP** communication. After the serial communication has been established, only commands can be sent to the device, as there is no response.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.80.121.55.*
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, e.g. *4050.* Required.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, e.g. *50*. Not required.

#### HTTP connection

This connector also uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

## Usage

### General Page

It also displays the **Current** **Transport** **Status** and **State**, the **CA** **Condition** and the **Current** **URI**.

With the **Tuning to Channel** button, the **Service Key** can be set to the device. You can also send a PIN code to the device using **Send User PIN**.

Finally, you can also modify the **Default PIN**, which will be stored on the Default PIN Code pop-up page.
