# Telenet Ticket Table

## About

The **Telenet Ticket Table** connector is part of the **SAM** system. It is the link between alarms on **DataMiner** and other connectors that will generate tickets. This connector will retrieve a list of the **current active alarms** that need a ticket and group them into tickets.

The retrieved alarms will be linked to a specific **ticket topology**. Each of these groups will trigger a flow that will **create**, **update**, or **close** a ticket. The timing of these triggers can be configured. However, there is a built-in priority to creation of a ticket.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

### Ticket Processing Configuration

Delays need to be configured on **Create**, **Update**, and **Close**. These delays indicate how long an alarm or ticket needs to exist before the command is sent. For "Close", the delay takes place after all linked alarms are gone.

A retry can be configured for when a **script** fails to start the flow to **create**, **update** or **close** a ticket.

In case of a specific **Not Owner** error on **creation** or **update** of a ticket, it is possible to determine a delay before a retry is done.

To run a flow, a **script** is started. This flow could take some time. To keep a limit on the currently running scripts, you can configure this in **Max Running Scripts**.

To keep track of the lifecycle of the connector, you can add the **DMA/Element ID** of the **heartbeat element**.

There is a limit on the number of tickets that can be created or scheduled, i.e. the **Max Trouble Ticket Count**. This needs to be configured via the **Event Storm** page button.

## How to Use

When the connector has been configured as detailed above, it will run automatically based on the input of the alarms. The current situation can be monitored.

## Notes

The connector will only work in a **SAM** system containing extra connectors and **Automation scripts**
