# AJA BRIDGE NDI 3G

## About

The AJA Bridge NDI 3G connector enables seamless integration with AJA Bridge NDI 3G, a 1RU gateway offering high-density conversion from SDI to NDI and from NDI to SDI for Ultra HD/4K, HD, and SD signals.

## Key Features

- **Overview:** Displays the tree control linked to the setup of the device. The device consists of engines, which contain banks, which in turn contain up to four channels (tiles).
- **Sources:** Displays the sources linked to the NDI connection, as well as the active mapping of the different channels.
- **Network:** Displays the overview of the networks attached to the device.

## Use Case

**Challenges**: Using the API directly to control or update data is not user-friendly and is likely to lead to inconsistencies. 

**Solution**: Installing the AJA Bridge NDI 3G connector will allow you to manage this functionality through configurable pipelines, which you can set up and monitor via the connector interface.
