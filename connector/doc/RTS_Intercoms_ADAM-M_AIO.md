This connector is designed to monitor and configure a mid-size modular matrix intercom, with 128+ ports in a compact 3RU (rack unit) package and full redundancy of the master controllers and power supplies. The matrix frame supports all current ADAM cards, including AIO-16, RVON-16, MADI-16 Plus, Tribus and MCII-e controllers. It also supports existing ADAM wiring schemes and options. The chassis plugs-and-plays anywhere, running on 90 to 264 Vac at 50/60 Hz.
