# SES S.A. O3b mPOWER

## About

The **SES S.A. O3b mPOWER** connector brings real-time visibility of O3b mPOWER terminals into DataMiner. It brings together **status, performance, and location** insights, letting network teams, NOCs, and service providers monitor their MEO services from a single pane of glass.

## Key Features

- **Centralized terminal monitoring**: Track terminal status and service health across your O3b mPOWER footprint in one place.
- **Real-time performance insights**: Follow throughput, latency, packet loss, signal quality (Es/No), and usage volumes per terminal.
- **Geospatial awareness**: Visualize terminal latitude/longitude, altitude, and heading to add context to performance and operations.
- **Built for scale**: Efficient polling and trending designed for large fleets and high-frequency updates.
- **Seamless DataMiner experience**: Leverage dashboards, alarms, and history to accelerate troubleshooting and SLA assurance.

## Use Cases

### Terminal Status Overview

**Challenge**: Operations teams need a fleet-wide view of terminal performance and status.

**Solution**: The connector centralizes live metrics per terminal in DataMiner.

**Benefit**: Faster triage and clearer situational awareness across the network.

### Proactive Monitoring

**Challenge**: Detecting degradations before customers are impacted.

**Solution**: Continuously monitor latency, packet loss, throughput, and Es/No to surface anomalies early.

**Benefit**: Proactive assurance, reduced MTTR, and fewer escalations.

### Insight in Usage Patterns

**Challenge**: Understanding usage patterns for capacity planning and customer support.

**Solution**: Track forward/return volumes and throughput to identify trends and right-size resources.

**Benefit**: Data-driven capacity management and improved customer experience.
