## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Initialization

The **Web Interface** login credentials on the **Security** page need to be filled in to allow the **Sync Monitoring** data to be retrieved.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element using this connector consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page allows you to monitor and configure basic information about the device, e.g. **System Description**, **Firmware Version**.

It can also be used to request the execution of commands to the time server.

The page also contains page buttons to the following subpages:

- **System Hardware:** Lists all power supplies and system fans.
- **Reference Clocks:** Lists all reference clocks and their configuration.

### Network

This page allows you to monitor all interfaces and their metrics, e.g. **Bit Rate**, **Maximum Transmission Unit**.

It also contains page buttons to the following subpages:

- **Device Interfaces**: Lists all the metrics of each interface.
- **Ethernet**: Allows you to configure general Ethernet parameters.
- **Physical Interfaces**: Allows you to configure physical options for each Ethernet interface.
- **VLAN Interfaces**: Allows you to configure VLAN options for each Ethernet interface.
- **Miscellaneous Interfaces**: Allows you to configure miscellaneous options for each Ethernet interface.
- **IP Interfaces**: Allows you to configure IP options for each Ethernet interface.
- **Services Interfaces**: Allows you to enable services for each Ethernet interface.
- **Cluster Interfaces**: Allows you to configure cluster options for each Ethernet interface.

### Notification

This page allows you to configure notification settings for the device, e.g. **Email notifications**, **External Syslog Server**.

### Security

This page allows you to configure basic security settings for the device, e.g. **Root Login**, **Network Discovery**.

### SNMP

This page allows you to configure SNMP settings for the device, e.g. **SNMP Contact**, **SNMP Retries**.

It also contains page buttons to the following subpages:

- **Trap Receiver:** Allows you to configure each trap receiver.
- **Trap Configuration:** Allows you to enable signaling information for specific events, e.g. **Antenna Faulty**, **Fan Failure**.
  Multiple signaling outputs can be configured, e.g. E-mail, SNMP, VP100. A comma-separated string stating the signaling outputs is to be set for each event.

### NTP

This page allows you to monitor and configure NTP information regarding the device, e.g. **Trust Time**, **Client Counter Duration**. It displays statistics regarding the client counter of the device.

It also contains page buttons to the following subpages:

- **External NTP**: Allows you to configure each NTP server.
- **Broadcast Settings**: Lists all broadcast servers.
- **Routing**: Allows you to configure the Multicast and Manycast settings.

### PTP

This page allows you to monitor PTP parameters for each PTPv2 module, e.g. **PTP seconds**, **Delay Mechanism**. The PTP table allows you to **remove DVEs** for modules that have been deleted. An "Auto-remove DVEs" option is also available for the automatic removal of DVEs.

The page also contains page buttons to the following subpages:

- **Network Configuration**: Allows the network configuration of each PTPv2 module.
- **Module Configuration**: Allows you to configure PTP-specific variables for each PTPv2 module.

### Sync Monitoring

This page allows you to monitor the status nodes and their configuration, e.g. **Location**, **Offset Limit**.

However, for this, the **Web Interface** login credentials on the **Security page** must be filled in.

Note that the Sync Monitoring Table is only displayed if at least **firmware version 7.xx** is used.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.0.x** range of the Meinberg Lantime M3000 connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

Connectivity for all exported connectors is managed by the parent connector Meinberg Lantime M3000. Each row in the **PTP** table (PTP page) establishes a physical dynamic interface.
