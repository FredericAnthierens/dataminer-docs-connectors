# Evertz Scorpion 18

This protocol is used to monitor the Evertz Scorpion 18 device.

The SCORPION-X18 Media Processing Platform is a high-density signal conversion, video processing, routing, aggregation, and transport platform capable of simultaneously transporting video, audio and data over traditional dark fiber and/or managed IP networks. Using SCORPION Mini I/O modules, the SCORPION-X18 is highly flexible and can accommodate 12G/6G/3G/HD/SD-SDI, DVB-ASI, 10/100/1000 MbE, 10 GbE, analog/AES/MADI audio, HDMI, intercom, serial data, and Telco interfaces. An on-board 12G crosspoint allows uncompressed routing internal to the chassis.
