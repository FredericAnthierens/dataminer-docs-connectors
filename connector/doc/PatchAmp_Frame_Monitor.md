# PatchAmp Frame Monitor

## About

The **PatchAmp Frame Monitoring System** (RMS) integrates standard distribution amplifiers with a remote software package, creating a comprehensive signal verification solution. The system provides real-time monitoring and instant reporting of critical parameters such as signal presence, lock status, module temperature, fiber transmit and receive levels, and fiber laser metrics. This universal frame can accommodate any combination of cards, with the monitoring circuit being a standard feature across all PatchAmp distribution amplifiers.

With this **PatchAmp Frame Monitor** connector, you can monitor the status of all 32 possible cards. For active cards, you can access metrics such as temperature, supply voltage, optical power, and more.

### Version Info

### Key Features

- **Real-time parameter extraction**: The connector continuously retrieves and displays critical signal metrics, including loss of signal, lock status, module temperature, fiber transmit/receive levels, and laser diagnostics, enabling proactive monitoring and alarm generation.

- **Seamless integration with PatchAmp modules**: Designed to communicate with the PatchAmp Frame Monitoring System, the connector supports automatic detection of and data retrieval from any combination of installed modules, ensuring comprehensive visibility across the entire system.

## Use Cases

### Ensuring Broadcast Signal Integrity with Real-Time Monitoring

**Challenge**: Broadcasting facilities require continuous monitoring of signal integrity to prevent downtime and maintain high-quality transmissions.

**Solution**: The PatchAmp RMS provides real-time alerts on signal loss, lock issues, and module performance metrics, enabling prompt corrective actions.

**Benefit**: Ensures uninterrupted broadcasting by allowing immediate response to potential signal issues, maintaining transmission quality and reliability.

### Simplifying Amplifier Management with a Universal Monitoring System

**Challenge**: Managing a diverse array of distribution amplifiers can be complex, especially when integrating different module types within a single system.

**Solution**: The PatchAmp RMS's universal frame supports any combination of cards, each of which can be monitored using the PatchAmp Frame Monitor connector.

**Benefit**: Reduces complexity in system setup and maintenance, offering flexibility and scalability in broadcast infrastructure.

## Technical info

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.2 or higher** is required for compatibility with the PatchAmp Frame Monitor connector.
