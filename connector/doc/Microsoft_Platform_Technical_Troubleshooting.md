# Troubleshooting

## Access is denied with error code 0x80070005 (or 0x80041003)

**Symptom**

The following errors are shown in the Stream Viewer (when looking at the communication of any group):

- Access is denied with error code 0x80070005
- Access is denied with error code 0x80041003

**Cause**

The username does not have enough permissions to query the server, specifically when performing remote WMI queries using non-admin users.

**Resolution**

- Access is denied with error code 0x80070005: See [DCOM configuration](xref:Connector_help_Microsoft_Platform_Technical#dcom-configuration)
- Access is denied with error code 0x80041003: See [WMI configuration](xref:Connector_help_Microsoft_Platform_Technical#wmi-configuration)
- If the above options do not solve the issue, try to open Windows Explorer on the monitored server, using the username that you configured on the [Settings](xref:Connector_help_Microsoft_Platform_Technical#security) page. If it is not possible to connect to the server because you have to log on with the account *guest*, execute the following steps:

  1. Go to **Control Panel** \> **Administrative Tools** \> **Local Security Policy**.
  1. Go to **Local Policies** \> **Security Options**.
  1. Double-click **Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts**.
  1. Select **Classic- local users authenticate as themselves**.

> [!NOTE]
> To confirm that a user does not have the rights to perform WMI queries, you can proceed as follows:
>
> 1. Click **Start** \> **Run** and execute *wmimgmt.msc*.
> 1. Right-click **WMI Control (Local)** and select **Connect to another computer**.
> 1. Select **Actions** \> **More Actions** \> **Properties**.
>
> At this point, you will receive the following error:
>
> ```text
> Failed to connect to [\\%RemoteIP%](file:///) because "Win32 Access is denied".
> ```
>
> If the above steps are not possible, you could also run **wmimgmt.msc** directly on the server (from CMD or PowerShell). You will receive the following error: Microsoft Management Console "An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist".

## Not all parameters are initialized

**Symptom**

A Microsoft element displays a partial set of the data. Some parameters, such as *Local Time*, *Total Physical Memory*, etc. are populated, while others like *Total Processor Load*, *Total Handles* remain not initialized. Looking at the **Stream Viewer**, you notice certain queries do not return any results.

**Cause**

There can be different possible causes for this behavior. Refer to the possible resolutions below.

**Resolution**

- Check the element timeout settings. When an element is created, these are the default values:

  - Timeout of a single command: 6000 ms
  - Number of retries: 3

  Update the timeout value if necessary, and validate whether the element is now able to poll all parameters.

- Execute the following command (using CMD or PowerShell) to manually reset the counters with WMI (for more information, refer to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/manually-rebuild-performance-counters)):

  ```cmd
  winmgmt.exe /resyncperf
  ```

- Verify whether the user used to query the server is included in the group *Performance Monitor Users*.

## Query failed: Retrieving the data failed. (hr = 0x80041010)

**Symptom**

Stream Viewer shows the following error:

```text
Query failed : Retrieving the data failed. (hr = 0x80041010) for numerous WQL SELECT queries.
```

**Cause**

Some or all related Disable Performance Counters in regedit for `PerfDisk`, `PerfNet`, `PerfOS`, `PerfProc`, `Tcpip`, or `W3SVC` are set to **1**. With the path below, you can confirm if these counters are disabled:

```text
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfProc\Performance\
```

When wbemtest is used and these queries are performed, or the classes are listed, this results in similar errors mentioning "Invalid class".

**Solution**

Set all these to **0**, and after a couple of minutes the query errors should disappear and the related data should get filled in.

## Query failed: Retrieving the data failed. (hr = 0x80041017)

**Symptom**

The Task Manager table remains empty, and Stream Viewer shows the following error:

```text
Query WMI failed. Retrieving the data failed. (hr = 0x80041017) for numerous WQL SELECT queries.
```

**Cause**

Unclear, but one of the symptoms is that, when viewed in the wbemtest tool, the *Win32_PerfRawData_PerfProc_Process* class seems to be incomplete (i.e. it misses for example the IDProcess property, but also many others).

**Solution**

Open a command prompt on the server as Administrator and execute the "lodctr /r" command. This will reconstruct the performance counters, and after about 10 minutes the Task Manager in the element should start to contain entries.

However, note that this is not a permanent solution. Each time the server is rebooted, this command will need to be executed again. If you would like to discuss this solution with Skyline Communications or want to propose an alternative solution that persists across server reboots, please get in touch with your Skyline contact person.

## Contacting Server Failed: Connection to root/cimv2 failed. The RPC server is unavailable

**Symptom**

The following error occurs:

```text
Contacting server failed: Connection to \[//server/root/cimv2\] failed. The RPC server is unavailable. (hr = 0x800706BA).
```

**Cause**

Configuration issue on the remote server.

**Solution**

- Make sure TCP/135 and TCP/49000-65535 (WMI) are open.
- Make sure the user is created on server and host.

## Performance Monitoring not working

**Symptom**

The element is able to populate all parameters, except the Performance Monitor. Clicking *Refresh Categories* triggers the following error in element logging:

```text
Exception Perf Counters The network path was not found.
```

**Cause**

Possible configuration issue on the remote server.

**Solution**

Check if the destination computer has the "Remote Registry" service running. If not, start this service. (Note that you may need to adjust the Startup Type from *Disabled* to *Manual/automatic* first.)

## Percent Disk Busy Time goes above 100%

**Symptom**

The parameter **Percent Disk Busy Time** shows values higher than 100%.

**Cause**

By design.

**Resolution**

Not applicable. More information can be found in the [Microsoft Knowledge Base](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310067).

## Additional Notes

### Windows Vista

From Windows 2000 onwards, WMI is installed by default. Except in Windows Vista, WMI uses random ports. To configure a fixed port in Windows Vista:

1. In the command prompt window, type *winmgmt -standalonehost.*
1. Stop the WMI service by typing the command *net stop "Windows Management Instrumentation"*.
1. Restart the WMI service in a new service host by typing *net start "Windows Management Instrumentation"*.
1. Establish a new port number for the WMI service by typing *netsh firewall add portopening port=24158 name=WMIFixedPort*.

If you want to have access to the WMI interface of a Windows XP computer, you can work with a local user (a group user, not an administrator) that has the necessary Windows security rights, so extra configuration is necessary on the client computers.

### Re-registering the WMI component on the monitored server

In some situations, you will need to re-register the WMI component in the monitored server.

- For 32-bit Windows OS, the `.dll` and `.exe` files used by WMI are located in `%windir%\system32\wbem`.
- For 64-bit Windows OS, these files are located in `%windir%\sysWOW64\wbem`.

To re-register the WMI components, run the following commands with the command prompt:

```cmd
cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem*
for %i in (*.dll) do RegSvr32 -s %i
for %i in (*.exe) do %i /RegServer
```
