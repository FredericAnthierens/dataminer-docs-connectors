# NTT Electronics HC32000E

## About

The NTT Electronics HC32000E is a high-density video encoder designed for real-time transmission of multiple HD and 4K UHD streams using HEVC (H.265) or H.264 (AVC) compression. It enables simultaneous encoding of up to 2 x 4K or 8 x HD video streams in a compact 1RU chassis, delivering broadcast-quality video with high efficiency and support for complex audio workflows.

### Key Features

- **Device status monitoring**: Monitor multiple device parameters such as IP, network status, input sources, and encoding settings.

- **Input and output configuration**: Configure various input and output settings, including audio, audio gain, video options, and IP data.

- **Network configuration and monitoring**: Set up network interfaces, SNMP, Web UI, PPPoE, syslog, and remote monitoring servers. Customize device settings such as NTP, scrambled audio encryption, BISS encoding, and event log levels.

- **Encoder setup**: Adjust transport stream settings, including program and audio configurations. Fine-tune video settings, BISS, TCP, multi-streaming, and video options.

## Use Case: Remote Monitoring and Network Management

**Challenge:** A live event production team needs to encode multiple high-resolution video feeds on site and deliver them reliably over IP networks to a central broadcast hub.

**Solution:** Using the HC32000E connector, DataMiner enables real-time monitoring and control of HEVC 4:2:2 10-bit encoding, network settings, and stream management for the HC32000E encoder deployed at the event location.

**Benefit:** Achieve reliable, high-quality contribution encoding with low latency by integrating the HC32000E into the DataMiner digital twin, ensuring full visibility and remote management of the encoding workflow.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.3 or higher** is required.
