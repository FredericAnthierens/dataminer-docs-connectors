## Installation and configuration

### Creation

The element using this connector can be automatically created by the parent element using the **Axon ACP** connector, but it can also be a standalone element.

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, being the slot number of the card.

#### Serial Broadcast Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## Usage

This element has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: **Card Name**, **Card Description**, **SW Revision**, **HW Revision**, etc.
- **Status**
- **Add-On**
- **Channel**
- **Channel 01/04**
- **Channel 05/08**
- **Channel 09/12**
- **Channel 13/16**
- **Settings**
- **Voice Over**
- **Loudness**
- **Decoder**
- **Decoder Metadata**
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Axon ACP connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).
