## About

This **Telenor EPM MAM Consumer** is used to collect messages stored in RabbitMQ queues and forward them to multiple **Telenor EPM Collector** elements.

To be aware of the collector elements available in the system, the connector will read provision files created by the **Telenor EPM Manager** element.

## Key Features

- **Consume RabbitMQ messages**: The connector can connect to multiple Rabbit MQ servers.
- **Message forwarding**: The connector automatically detects to which collector the messages needs to be forwarded.
