# Evertz Scorpion 18 APP-IPG

## About

The SCORPION-18 APP-IPG is a software app that turns a SCORPION-18 frame into a high-density IP media gateway, encapsulating/de-encapsulating SDI (up to 12G) to/from SMPTE ST 2110 (and, in variants, ST 2022-6), with hitless 2022-7 support. It runs on the SCORPION-18's NETAD compute and provides multiple configurable gateway paths.

## Key Features

- **Format support**: UHD/4K/3G/HD/SD, including 4K single-link or quad-link.

- **Trunking**: QSFP uplinks up to 10/25/40/100 GbE.

## Use Cases

### Unified monitoring of Evertz gear (SNMP)

**Challenge**: Monitoring of Evertz devices is scattered over different locations.

**Solution**: DataMiner can ingest alarms/metrics via VistaLINKÂ® SNMP (Evertz frame/controllers expose SNMP), so SCORPION and other Evertz modules show up in the same NMS as your switches.

**Benefit**: You can use one central location to monitor all your Evertz devices.
