## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the data pages described below.

### Spectrum Analyzer Page

This page contains the Spectrum Analysis user interface. On the left, a graphical view of the incoming signal is displayed. On the right, multiple settings are available that allow you to configure the displayed view and the spectrum analyzer. For more information, refer to the DMS Spectrum Analysis section of the DataMiner Help.

### General Page

This page displays general information about the analyzer: **Manufacturer**, **Model**, **Serial Number** and **Firmware Version**.

There are also several configuration parameters, such as:

- **Switch Position**: This parameter changes the selected input (1,2,3 or 4)*.*
- **Detection Mode**: Can be set to *Negative*, *Normal*, *Sample*, *Average* or *Peak.*
- **Amplitude Unit**: The unit can be configured; however, to retrieve correct traces it must be set to **dBm**.

Alarm monitoring can be enabled for these parameters. **Detection Mode** and **Automatic Alignment** can also be trended by DataMiner.
