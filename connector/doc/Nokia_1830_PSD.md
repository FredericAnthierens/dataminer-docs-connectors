# Nokia 1830 PSD Connector

## About

The Nokia 1830 PSD (Photonic Service Demarcation) connector enables monitoring and management of the Nokia 1830 PSD network interface device. The connector uses SNMP to collect interface and device-level metrics, facilitating early fault detection and performance monitoring across optical transport services.

This connector is designed to support customers using MEF-compliant 10G Ethernet and wavelength services via the Nokia 1830 PSD at customer premises.

## Key Features

- **SNMP-based monitoring**: Retrieves data using SNMP to monitor interface traffic and device health.
- **Device overview**: Shows general device information including model, IP, and status.
- **Interface metrics**: Displays per-interface statistics such as bit rate, packet rate, and operational status.
- **Alarm visibility**: Flags abnormal behavior or status to support prompt action.
- **Standards compliance**: Supports monitoring of MEF-compliant services and optical transport protocols.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1

**Challenge**: Monitoring of network demarcation points deployed at customer sites across an optical network.

**Solution**: Deploy the Nokia 1830 PSD connector to gather real-time performance data and interface statistics.

**Benefit**: Enhances visibility at the network edge, enabling proactive maintenance and improved SLA assurance.

### Use Case 2

**Challenge**: Lack of insight into interface-level traffic and device alarms in multi-site transport deployments.

**Solution**: Use the connector's interface metrics and alarm reporting features to track and respond to network events.

**Benefit**: Faster fault detection and root cause analysis, reducing downtime and improving network reliability.

### Use Case 3

**Challenge**: Integrating a new optical transport device into an existing monitoring platform.

**Solution**: Leverage the SNMP connection and standards-based metrics of the Nokia 1830 PSD connector.

**Benefit**: Seamless integration with minimal configuration effort, allowing consistent monitoring across diverse network elements.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- **Nokia 1830 PSD device** running firmware version 3.5.
- **SNMP access** enabled with appropriate community strings (default: `public` for GET, `private` for SET).
- **IP address and port** of the device available for polling.
