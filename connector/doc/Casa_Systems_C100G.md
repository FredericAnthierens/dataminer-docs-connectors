# Casa Systems C100G

The **Casa Systems C100G** connector uses **SNMPv2** to monitor and control the Casa Systems C100G. This device is a **CCAP**, which means it combines the functions of a **CMTS** and **edge QAM** into a single platform.

## About

The **Casa Systems C100G** is a chassis that has separate modules for downstream and upstream traffic, switching, etc.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMPv2 main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol version 2 connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

#### SNMPv2 spectrum analyzer connection (range 2.1.0.1)

To use the spectrum analyzer (range 2.1.0.1), configure a second SNMP connection using the same values as for the primary SNMP connection.

#### SNMPv2 connection (range 5.0.0.1)

When you use the custom version, you should set the timeout of the element to 10 seconds in order to avoid unnecessary timeouts.

If a restart of the element is necessary, stop the element and wait a few seconds before restarting it; there can be blockages in the equipment if it is not allowed to finish previously requested actions.

## Usage (Range 1.0.0.x and 2.0.0.x)

### General

This page displays general information about the device. This information is divided into several groups:

- **General Info**: System information, such as the **System Name**, **System Up Time**, etc.
- **Cable Modems Info**: Information about the cable modems managed by the device.
- **Upstream/Downstream Info**: Capacity and bitrate upstream and downstream information.

### Spectrum Settings

This page allows you to configure the spectrum analyzer interface.

Three options for tracing can be selected with the **Measurement Trace Selection** parameter:

- *Absolute*: Based on physical type interface power values.
- *Relative*: Based on logical type interface power values.
- *Disabled*: Default option. Disables the data tracing process.

In combination with the sweep time, the **Retrieval Time Control** adjusts the time to acquire the data via SNMP using a second connection.

Below this, you can select an interface based on what is selected for the Trace Selection parameter.

### Configuration

This section contains two pages: one for the upstream and one for the downstream channel configuration:

- The **Configuration -- Upstream Channels** page displays the **Configuration - Upstream Channels table**. This table contains the configuration data for the different upstream channels of the Casa Systems C100G, for example the **US Frequency**, **US Width**, etc.
- The **Configuration -- Downstream Channels** page is similar to the Configuration -- Upstream Channels page but displays the **Configuration - Downstream Channels table**. This table contains all configuration data for the downstream channels on the Casa Systems C100G.

### Measurements

This section also contains a page for the downstream channels and one for the upstream channels:

- The **Measurements -- Upstream Channels** page displays the **Measurements - Upstream Channels** **table**. This table contains the measurement information for the upstream channels. The table has an entry for each upstream channel. The **US CM Total** column will for example display how many cable modems use that particular interface.
- The **Measurements -- Downstream Channels** page is very similar to the Measurements -- Upstream Channels page, but this page displays the **Measurements - Downstream Channels table**, which displays the downstream measurements.
- The **Measurements -- Ethernet and Configuration -- Ethernet** page displays the **Gigabit Interface Table.** This table contains the Ethernet interfaces to monitor the traffic used.

### Performance

This section has several tables distributed over different pages:

- **Performance**: This page contains the **Power and Fan Status Tables**.
- **Temperature**: This page shows the **Temperature Status Table**.
- **CPU Status**: This page displays the **CPU Status Table**.
- **Memory Status**: This page contains the **Memory Status Table**.

### Extra

- The **Service Flow** page displays the **Service Flow Table**. This table describes the set of **DOCSIS-QOS Service Flows** in the managed device.

- The **Offload US/DS Channels** page can be used to offload the **interface data** to a semicolon-separated text file. The **location** and the **interval** to create these files can be specified on this page. This page also contains page buttons that can be used to access more detailed information about the **interfaces**, **modules**, etc. The **Redetect Config** button can be used to clear the upstream or downstream information from the different tables.

- The **Offload Topology** page can be used to offload 6 topology files: CM.csv, CMTS.csv, DSSG.csv, FNCMTS.csv, SG.csv and USSG.csv. These topology files contain information about the Cable Modems (CM.csv), Fiber Nodes (FNCMTS.csv), Service Groups (SG.csv) and DS/US Service Groups (USSG.csv and DSSG.csv) managed by the **Cable Systems C100G**. When the button **Get Topology** is pressed, the 6 files are created and stored in a folder with the name of the CMTS, inside the directory specified in the parameter **Local Location.**

- The **Ping Function** page can be used to ping devices. If **Ping Query** is *Enabled* and the **IP addresses** are filled in, the devices will be pinged and the **status** and **RTT** of the ping will be displayed. You can also provide a file containing the IP addresses of the devices you want to ping. In that case, the connector will ping the IP addresses in the **provisioning file**.

- The **Flap List** page displays the **Flap List Table**. This table displays more information about some of the cable modems managed by the **Cable Systems C100G**. The **Flap List Table** displays for example the number of **Flap Hits**, **Flap Misses**, etc.

- By default, the **Flap List** table is not polled by the connector, but polling can be enabled via the **Flap List Control** page. To access this page, click the **Flap List Control** page button. The **Flap List Control** subpage will also display extra information about the Flap List, like the **Flap List Current Size** and some **Thresholds**. You can also **reset** or **clear** the Flap List. If you only want the table polled once, click the **Refresh Flap List** button above the Flap List Table.
