# Intel BMC

## About

The **Intel Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)** is a built-in server management chip that lets you monitor, control, and troubleshoot systems remotely, even if the OS is down.

With the Intel BMC connector, you get access to **smarter server management**. It leverages the power of the OpenBMC Redfish API to monitor, control, and automate your infrastructure. From hardware health checks to power, thermal, and system insights, the Intel BMC connector gives you real-time visibility and remote management capabilities, all without stepping into the data center.

## Key Features

- **Remote System Management**: Monitor and control your server hardware without physical access, even when the operating system is offline.

- **Hardware Health Monitoring**: Real-time insights into CPU, memory, fans, storage, power supplies, and temperature sensors.

- **Power & Thermal Management**: Retrieve and control power usage, fan speeds, and thermal thresholds to optimize energy efficiency.

- **Event & Alert Handling**: Receive and process system events, alerts, and hardware status changes instantly.

- **Inventory & Configuration Access**: View detailed hardware inventory and adjust system settings remotely.

- **Secure Remote Access**: Built-in authentication and encrypted communication for safe server management.

- **Multi-System Support**: Manage multiple Intel Server Systems through a single integration.

## Use Cases

### Remote Troubleshooting in Data Centers

**Challenge**: A server in a remote data center becomes unresponsive, and on-site staff are unavailable to diagnose the issue.

**Solution**: The Intel BMC connector provides out-of-band access via the Redfish API, allowing admins to view system logs, monitor hardware health, and perform a remote reboot.

**Benefit**: Eliminates the need for on-site visits, reduces downtime, and speeds up incident resolution.

### Automated Hardware Health Checks

**Challenge**: Large server farms require daily health monitoring to detect failures before they impact services.

**Solution**: The Intel BMC connector integrates with DataMiner Automation scripts to query CPU temperatures, fan speeds, and power usage at regular intervals.

**Benefit**: Proactively detects hardware issues, reducing unplanned outages and improving service reliability.

### Energy Optimization in Cloud Environments

**Challenge**: High energy costs and thermal constraints in large-scale deployments.

**Solution**: The connector retrieves detailed power and thermal metrics via Redfish, enabling automated cooling and power usage adjustments.

**Benefit**: Optimizes energy efficiency, lowers operational costs, and extends hardware lifespan.

### Asset Inventory and Compliance Auditing

**Challenge**: IT teams struggle to keep hardware inventory data up to date across multiple locations.

**Solution**: The Intel BMC connector collects inventory information (CPU, memory, firmware versions, etc.) automatically via API.

**Benefit**: Saves time on manual audits, ensures compliance, and improves asset tracking accuracy.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- A **valid BMC user account with correct login credentials** is required to access the Redfish API and retrieve system data.
