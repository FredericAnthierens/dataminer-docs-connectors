## Installation and configuration

### Creation

The element using this connector can be automatically created by the parent element using the **Axon ACP** connector, but it can also be a standalone element.

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, being the slot number of the card.

#### Serial Broadcast Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## Usage

This element has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: **Card Name**, **Card Description**, **SW Revision**, **HW Revision**, etc.
- **I/O**
- **SDI**
- **Add-On**
- **Video**
- **Preset**
- **Miscellaneous**
- **Embedder**
- **Embedder A**
- **Embedder B**
- **Embedder C**
- **Embedder D**
- **De-Embedder**
- **Dolby Digital**
- **Meta Data**
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Axon ACP connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Physical Interfaces

- **SDI Input 1**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SDI Input 2**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **REF Input 1**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **REF Input 2**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **QUAD-SPEED SYNAPSE Bus Input**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SDI Output 1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output 2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **QUAD-SPEED SYNAPSE Bus Output**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.

#### Virtual Interfaces

- **Multiplexer**: A single fixed interface of type **inout**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

When a DVE child element is created, the following connections are established:

- Between **SDI Input 1** and **Multiplexer**.
- Between **SDI Input 2** and **Multiplexer**.
- Between **QUAD-SPEED SYNAPSE Bus Input** and **Multiplexer**.
- Between **Multiplexer** and **SDI Output 1**.
- Between **Multiplexer** and **SDI Output 2**.
- Between **Multiplexer** and **SQUAD-SPEED SYNAPSE Bus Output**.

Depending on the state of **Active Output 1**, the following connections are established:

- **SDI-1**: Between **SDI Input 1** and **SDI Output 1**.
- **SDI-2**: Between **SDI Input 2** and **SDI Output 1**.

Depending on the state of **Active Output 2**, the following connections are established:

- **SDI-1**: Between **SDI Input 1** and **SDI Output 2**.
- **SDI-2**: Between **SDI Input 2** and **SDI Output 2**.
