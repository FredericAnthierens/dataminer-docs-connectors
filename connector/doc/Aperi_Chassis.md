## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

#### IP Dataplane SSH Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

- **Port:**

  - The Telnet port of the device (**1.0.0.x**).
  - The SSH port of the device (**1.0.1.x**), by default **222**.

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses an SNMP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Port**: Default is **161.**
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.

#### IP Linux SSH Connection

This connector uses an SSH connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SSH CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Port**: The SSH port of the device (**1.0.3.x**), by default **22**.

#### IP Controlplane SSH Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Port:** The SSH port of the device (**1.0.4.x**), by default **223**.

### Initialization

To make sure the full functionality of the element becomes available, you must enter a valid username and password to connect to the device. To do so, on the **Security** page, fill in the correct **username** and **password**.

From version 1.0.2.x onwards, you also need to fill in the **Device IP** on the **General** page to support SNMP traps.

From version 1.0.3.x onwards, on the **Polling Manager** subpage of the **General** page, you can enable or disable the polling of specific groups and control the polling interval for the groups.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.0.x** range of the Aperi Chassis connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and DataMiner third-party protocols (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- **Interface** is the physical dynamic interface created and the interface type is **inout**.
