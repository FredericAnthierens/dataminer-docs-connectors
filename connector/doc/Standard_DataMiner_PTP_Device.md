## Configuration

### Initialization

This is a **mediation** protocol, which means no element needs to be created. The only thing needed to activate this mediation protocol is to set it as **Production**.

As soon as this is done, this mediation protocol will be active for all mediated protocols.

## Notes

This connector should not be accessed directly by the user.

It is a mediation protocol that is used by the **PTP application** to easily get the values of the different PTP parameters from each supported device.

The PTP-related parameters of the mediated protocols that cannot be linked to a mediation parameter are grouped in a custom tag `<RelatedProtocols\>`. This tag is used by the Skyline PTP app.
