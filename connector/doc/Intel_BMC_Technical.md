## About

The Intel Integrated Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is a critical component of server management, providing remote monitoring and control capabilities for Intel® Server Systems powered by the Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family.

This controller implements the OpenBMC Redfish API specification, supporting industry-standard Redfish schemas for system management. These schemas define available resources, including their URIs, supported HTTP methods, properties, links, and actions, enabling seamless integration with automation and orchestration tools.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- IP address/host: The polling IP of the device.
- IP port: The device API IP Port (default 443)
- Bus address: ByPassProxy

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
