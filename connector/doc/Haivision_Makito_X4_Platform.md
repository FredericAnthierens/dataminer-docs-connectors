# Haivision Makito X4 Platform

## About

This integration enables monitoring and control of **Haivision Makito X4** devices, offering a unified solution for both video encoding and decoding. It combines the capabilities of Makito X4 encoders and decoders into a single platform.

## Key Features

- **Dual-functionality (encoder/decoder)**: Automatically detects and configures the device as either an encoder or decoder based on system response, with manual override available.
- **Stream and device monitoring**: Access detailed statistics for decoder and encoder performance analysis.
- **Flexible polling configuration**: Customize polling intervals for each command or disable unnecessary ones to optimize system performance.
- **Secure HTTP communication**: Establish secure connections using HTTP with configurable IP, port, and credentials.
- **Comprehensive stream management**: Monitor and manage video/audio encoders, encoder streams, decoders, and decoder streams through dedicated pages.

## Use Case: Deploying Versatile Encoding/Decoding Across a Network

**Challenge**: Gaining centralized visibility and control over a video infrastructure, for instance when streaming live events or managing broadcast feeds.

**Solution**: Integrate Makito X4 devices into your DataMiner System.

**Benefit**: Streamlined operations and enhanced diagnostics through unified monitoring, reducing downtime and improving content delivery quality.
