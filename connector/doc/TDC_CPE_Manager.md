## Installation and configuration

### Configuration of elements

Two types of elements are needed for this setup:

- A single front-end element (CPE FE), responsible for aggregating data at the top levels.
- Multiple back-end elements (CPE BE), each responsible for some OLT devices. These elements will perform the aggregation of the data coming from the collector elements.

### Configuration of parameters

The CPE Manager's Data Display pages are not intended to be opened. Instead, any configuration should be performed via a visual overview or multiple set.

### Configuration of offload

The following parameters can be set via **multiple set** in order to configure the offload mechanism to all related elements:

- **Offload CMC State**: Enables or disables the offload CMC data mechanism. Default value: *Disabled*.

- **Offload AMP State**: Enables or disables the offload AMP data mechanism. Default value: *Disabled*.

- **Offload CMC Cleanup State**: Enables or disables the file cleanup mechanism.
  - If this parameter is enabled, all files in the **Offload CMC Directory** that are older than the age defined in the **Offload** **File Age Threshold** parameter will be deleted.
  - This parameter is automatically enabled when the **Offload CMC State** is also enabled.
  - Default value: *Disabled*.

- **Offload CMC Directory**: The root directory where the offload files will be stored.

- The directory can be a shared folder. The credentials for the folder can be set using the **Offload Shared Folder Username** and **Offload Shared Folder Password** parameters.
  - A folder will be created per OLT with its name - the **OLT Name.**
  - Default value: *\\80.62.121.234\c\$\Skyline_Data\BE Manager Offload\\*

- **Offload AMP Directory**: The root directory where the offload files will be stored.
  - The directory can be a shared folder. The credentials for the folder can be set using the **Offload Shared Folder Username** and **Offload Shared Folder Password** parameters.
  - A folder will be created per OLT with its name - the **OLT Name.**
  - Default value: *\\80.62.121.234\c\$\Skyline_Data\AMP\\*

- **Offload File Age Threshold**: Determines for how long files are stored in the **Offload CMC Directory** before they are deleted to free up space.

- Range between *8 hours* and *1 year*, with 8-hour increments.
  - Default value: *2 weeks*

- **Force Offload / Offload To Disk**: Set this button to manually execute the offload of the files, regardless of both **Offload State (CMC/AMP)** values.

- **Debug Log Times**: Enables or disables extra logging related to the offload.

- If this parameter is enabled, upon a successful offload, the time and number of rows will be added in the element's log.

- **Offload Config String \[table name\]**: Contains all the column parameters that should be offloaded for the related table (specified in brackets).

- Multiple columns can be specified, with a comma (",") as separator.
  - The primary key will always be offloaded as the first column.
  - Information template column names are not supported.

The offload will not occur to front-end managers.

The offload files will always contain the primary key of the tables and a column with the **OLT Name** linked to each entry.

The files will be separated per OLT, inside the **Offload CMC Directory** and **Offload AMP Directory**. This means that each file will only contain the entries of a table related to a single OLT.

## Usage

If you open the card for this element in Cube, the CPE interface will be displayed, with different chains providing a different topology view.

If you fill in one of the filters (on the left), the topology diagram view is displayed. If you click a KPI item in this diagram view, a pop-up window with parameters opens.

### AMP Chain Export

The **BE Managers** have the possibility to export AMP Chain data to be further ingested by the **CM Collectors** (*TDC OLT CM Collector*). This data is useful to map the CM's channels to amplifiers.

If **CM AMP Chain Export State** is *enabled*, the **BE Manager** elements will create these files in the directory specified as the **CM AMP Chain Export Folder**, during the full provisioning. The result status is displayed by the **CM AMP Chain Export Status** parameter.

A file is created per **CM Collector** and contains 2 columns: the cable modem *MAC addresses* and the respective *AMP Chains*. The files can be identified by the *dmaId/elementId* of the **CM Collector** element responsible for ingesting them.

Only the newest files will be ingested by the **CM Collector**. Older files are moved to a backup folder (under the original one).

For maintenance purposes, files older than 7 days are deleted.

## IAM DB

The entire CPE setup is provisioned via a MySQL database called IAM.

There is also a fully automatic system to create new elements, assign properties and place the elements in the correct views based on the info from the IAM DB. The connector responsible for this is **Skyline IAM DB Provision**.

### Configuration of IAM Database

- DB Server Settings:

- DB Name: IAM
  - Server Name: IP address
  - DB Username
  - DB Password
