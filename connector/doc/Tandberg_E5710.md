- **Device address**: Not needed.

**SNMP Settings**:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.1.1.x** connector range of the Tandberg E5710 connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- In/Out: Every row added to Remote DCF Interface Table will automatically add an in/out interface.

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- Inputs: Every input from the Port Table will create an input.
- Outputs: Every output from the Port Table will create an output.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Video:

  - Serial Digital: connection between \[Serial Video Input\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].
  - Analogue/Parallel 656: connection between \[Composite Video Input\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].

- Audio:

  - Connection between \[Serial Video Input\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].
  - Connection between \[Composite Audio Input\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].

- Data:

  - RS 232: connection between \[Data Input with PortDataType = RS 232\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].
  - RS 422: connection between \[Data Input with PortDataType = RS 422\] and the \[DVB ASI Outputs\].
