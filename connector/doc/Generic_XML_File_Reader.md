#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

After you have specified a valid folder name and a file name, click **Check***,* and the content of the specified XML is retrieved. If any tag was left open in the file, the status of the file will indicate a failure.

You can also validate the XML to a provided schema. If all the elements are in order, **File Schema Validation** will be *OK*.
