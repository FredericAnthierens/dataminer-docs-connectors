## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *30604*).

## How to use

The API connection requires the definition of the **Username** and **Password** on the **Configuration** page.

If these have been correctly filled in, the connector will poll the information and fill in the tables.

The data is also exported to a path defined in the **Export Path** parameter.
