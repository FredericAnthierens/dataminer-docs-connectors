# ISS Tracker

## About

The ISS Tracker connector provides real-time tracking and monitoring of the International Space Station (ISS). This connector integrates live positional data, crew information, and data retrieval status information, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

The ISS Tracker module offers seamless integration with DataMiner, allowing for intuitive visualization of ISS metrics, including latitude, longitude, and current crew details. This real-time feed is essential for monitoring ISS movements and operational insights.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - ISS Tracker API

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: `api.open-notify.org` (Public API for real-time ISS position)
- **IP port**: `80` (Default HTTP port)
- **Bus address**: Not required

## Stream Viewer

DataMiner's Stream Viewer tool can be used to monitor HTTP traffic between the ISS Tracker connector and the external data source. The connector establishes two HTTP sessions to retrieve ISS tracking and crew information. If both sessions return the status OK with the expected response body, the connection is considered operational. Otherwise, further troubleshooting may be required to resolve connectivity or API response issues.

Additionally, there is a parameter that displays the connectivity status. It can display status messages that include:

- **OK**
- **Error**
- **API Not Responding**

If any message other than OK appears, the Stream Viewer should be checked.

## General Functionality

The ISS Tracker connector retrieves real-time data from the API and displays it in DataMiner. The following key metrics are available:

- **Latitude & Longitude**: The exact position of the ISS at any given time.
- **Crew Information**: The current astronauts aboard the ISS and other craft.

You can visualize ISS movement and view historical data for analysis.

## Data Retrieval Process

1. The connector sends an HTTP GET request to `api.open-notify.org`.
1. The API responds with a JSON object containing the latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
1. Data is parsed and displayed in a DataMiner element.

## Notes

- The connector is dependent on the availability of the Open Notify API.
- Future updates may include additional space station tracking.
