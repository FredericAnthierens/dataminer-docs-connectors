- **Telemetry and metrics collection**: Get an overview of network, throughput, and stream statistics.
- **Configuration and metadata sync**: Keep an eye on device settings, firmware versions, and other metadata.
- **Alerts and events**: Get easy access to logging for alerts and events.

## Key features

### Devices Monitoring

Effortlessly monitor all your connected devices in real time. The Haivision Manager connector provides a comprehensive overview of every online device, including detailed information such as device identifiers, hardware IDs, product types, versions, encoder counts, mission assignments, and even GPS location. You can instantly see which devices are active and access their current operational status, ensuring full visibility and control over your network at all times.

### Outputs Monitoring

Gain complete control over your media outputs with advanced monitoring capabilities. The Haivision Manager connector allows you to track the status of all output types (NDI, IP, and SDI) across your infrastructure. For each output, you can view its current state (Play, Pause, or Stop), locking status, input details, and associated device information. With integrated Play and Stop stream commands, you can start or halt media streams directly from the management interface, enabling rapid responses and seamless workflow management. You can also play or stop a stream on the output.
