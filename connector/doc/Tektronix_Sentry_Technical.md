## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: Not used.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Initialization (Before 1.3.0.x)

The first time you start a **Tektronix Sentry** element, enter a username and a password in the **Configuration** dialog box.

1. Go to the **General** page.
1. Click the **Configuration** page button.
1. Enter the **Username** and **Password**.
1. Select to **Enable**/**Disable** KPI2.
1. If necessary, change the **Timespan Value**. This setting defines which time slot is used to visualize the data. Range: *1 minute* to *60 minutes*.
1. Log on.

Note that the connector uses the JSON API, so the username that the element uses to connect to the device must be granted API access rights. To grant these rights:

1. Open the web interface.
1. Select **Configure** \> **Users**
1. Select the username.
1. Set **API Access** to *Yes*.

The API password must be the same as the password used to log in on the web interface.

### Initialization (Since 1.3.0.x)

1. Go to the **General** page.
1. Click the **Configuration** page button.
1. Enter the **Username** and **Password**.
1. Log on.

Note that the connector uses the JSON API, so the username that the element uses to connect to the device must be granted API access rights. To grant these rights:

1. Open the web interface.
1. Select **Configure** \> **Users**
1. Select the username.
1. Set **API Access** to *Yes*.

The API password must be the same as the password used to log in on the web interface.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are receiving a large number of "You must wait until..." errors, you may have to increase the **timeout of a single command (ms)** time in the element settings.

This page contains debug information in case something goes wrong.

The **Debug Logging** option can be used to enable additional element logging. However, do not leave this option set to *Enabled* any longer than necessary, as it can cause a large amount of extra logging to be generated.

If any of the API calls return an error message, this will be displayed in the **Error Message Table**. Alarm monitoring can be enabled on the **Number of Error Messages** parameter, so that users are warned when a large number of errors occur at the same time. Every hour, this parameter will be reset and the table will be cleared.

Below this, the **Communication Buffer Table** and the **State of Communication Buffer** parameter are displayed, which show all the calls that are in the queue to be sent to the device. Alarm monitoring can be enabled on the state parameter, so that users are warned when a call takes too long (i.e. remains "Busy" for a long time).

## Notes

The information and details on the **RF Status Overview** page may not be correct in this version of the connector, as this is currently still under development. It is likely that this page will later be removed, as the *Tektronix Sentry Edge* connector can be used instead.
