# NTT Electronics HC32000D

## About

The **NTT Electronics HC32000D** is a K/60p HEVC 422 10bit multi-channel decoder.

## Key Features

- **Network configuration and monitoring**: Set up network interfaces, SNMP, TCP, PPPoE, syslog, and remote monitoring servers. Customize device settings including date/time, NTP, buzzer volume, and event log levels.
- **Input stream configuration**: Select and configure primary and secondary IP input streams, including stream parameters and receiver settings.
- **Decoder setup**: Adjust transport stream settings like program numbers and packet identifiers. Fine-tune video, audio, genlock decode options, and audio mapping.
- **Output signal management**: Define output settings for video, audio, and signaling to suit your downstream infrastructure.

## Use Cases

### Live Broadcast Contribution

**Challenge**: A live sports broadcaster needs to decode high-resolution HEVC streams from remote cameras with minimal delay for seamless on-air delivery.

**Solution**: Via the HC32000D connector, DataMiner monitors and manages the decoding of HEVC 4:2:2 10-bit IP streams in real time.

**Benefit**: Ensure ultra-low latency and high-quality video for live production by including the HC32000D decoder within the DataMiner digital twin of the system.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.4 or higher** is required.
