# Evertz Scorpion 6

This protocol is used to monitor the Evertz Scorpion 6 device.

The SCORPION-6 Media Processing Platform is a standalone, compact form factor, multi-service signal conversion, aggregation gateway capable of simultaneously transporting video, audio and data services over Ethernet and fiber networks. Using SCORPION Mini I/O modules, the SCORPION-6 can accommodate a multitude of signals including 4K SDI, Ethernet, MADI, AES, HDMI, intercom and serial data. The SCORPION-6 features encapsulation and de-encapsulation to IP over dual 10 GbE or 25 GbE trunk ports. When deployed as a flexible IP edge device, the SCORPION-6 becomes part of an integrated, scalable transport network, enabling the sharing of content from different sites using different transport media. The SCORPION-6 possesses a small fanless form factor and is designed to be operated in portable and/or low-noise environments. SCORPION-6 is ideal for mobile and live sports production applications.
