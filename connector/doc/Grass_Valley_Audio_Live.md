## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *2050*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Format: UU.PP where UU is the unit address and PP is the unit port. For example: *01.01*.

### Initialization

Default stream names are used in the router control tables. If you want custom names to be displayed, you can change the names in the DataMiner element. Custom names already configured on the device need to be retrieved separately. This can be done via the **Get Stream Names** button on the **General** page. **Do not change any configuration while this action is running, because then that change could be applied on the wrong stream!**

## How to use

The **General** page displays the overall status of the device.

The **Input** and **Output** pages can be used to configure the individual input/output streams. Stream status information is also displayed here. **Channel Delay** configuration can be accessed via the **Channels** page button.

The **Router Control** page provides an overview of all input and output channels. This is used for **audio channel shuffling** operations. Changing the **Connected Input** will cause a **Take** to be performed on the device.

The **Setup** page can be used to display and change all global configurations on the device.
