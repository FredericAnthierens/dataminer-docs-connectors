# ADVA Optical Networking FSP150CC

This is an **SNMP** connector that is used to monitor and configure the **ADVA Optical Networking FSP150CC** equipment.

## About

The information on tables and parameters is retrieved via SNMP polling.

The current traps implemented in version 1.0.2.6 and above are LinkUp, LinkDown, CmSysAlmTrap, CmNetworkElementAlarmTrap, CmNetworkElementEvent and CmSysEvent. These traps update the Interface, System Event and Network Element Event tables.

### System Alarms

This page displays the **System Event Table.**

It also contains a button, **Poll System Event Table**, which can be used to manually poll this table when necessary. Otherwise, the table is only polled every 24 hours because it is linked to the **System Alarm/Event traps**, which perform the update of the data as alarms/events are raised or cleared.

### NE Alarms

This page displays information about the **Network Element Event Table**. It also features a button, **Poll NE Event Table**, for similar reasons as explained in the System Alarms section above.

This page also displays extra information, such as **Last State Change** and **Event Counter**, and possible actions that can be applied to the element alarm settings, for example with the **Test Entity ID** and **Test Action buttons**, which are a combination of test parameters. Test Entity ID is the OID of the test object, e.g. the Network Interface OID. Test Action will raise or clear the test alarm on the object specified in Test Entity ID.

Finally, the **Trap File Size** parameter allows you to control the size of the log file, and the **Log Traps** parameter allows you to enable or disable the logging of the traps.

### Other Alarms

This page displays the **Alarm Severity Assignment Table** and the corresponding polling button.

On this page, the **IP Info** group displays the **Polling**, **Main** and **Backup** IPs with their respective **Status**. You can select the IP for the SNMP polling from the drop-down options of the **Polling** parameter.

### IP

This page displays the **IP Address**, **IP Interface** and **IP Management** tables. A page button in the lower-right corner displays the information from the **IP Info** group, with the **Switchback Delay** and **Switch Mode** parameters.

The **Switchback Delay** is the amount of time the connector should wait before switching back to the main IP in case polling is currently done from the backup IP.

The **Switch Mode** is the parameter that enables or disables the switchback delay. If the value of this parameter is *Automatic,* the connector will check if the main IP is stable for the amount of time specified in the Switchback Delay before switching to the main IP. To keep polling from the backup IP, you first need to disable the Switch Mode parameter, as otherwise the connector will switch back to the main IP after the delay.

Finally, the page also contains the **Static Route** table, with information such as the **Destination**, **Subnet Mask**, **Gateway**, type of **Interface** and **Metric**.

### Flow Statistics

This page displays the **Flow Statistics** table. These statistics include multiple kinds of **A2N/N2A Bit Rates**, **Unavailable/Errored/Severely Errored Seconds**, **A2N/N2A Bytes Received/Transmitted** and various statistics related to the **A2N/N2A Frames** count.

### Flow Statistics History

This page displays the **Flow Statistics History** table, with the history data of the **Flow Statistics** table.

### Web Interface

This page displays the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
