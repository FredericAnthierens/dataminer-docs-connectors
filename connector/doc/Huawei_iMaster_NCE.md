## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

To initialize the connector, go to the **Configuration** page of the element, fill in the **Username** and **Password** parameters, and click the **Authentication** button.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product. You also need to fill in the **Web Interface Address** parameter on the **Configuration** page.

## How to use

The **General** page displays a table containing all network elements managed by the iMaster NCE.

On the **Network Elements DVEs** subpage, you can **enable or disable a DVE** for each network element in the Network Elements DVEs Management table.

On the **Racks**, **Cards**, **Frames**, **Slots**, **Ports**, and **ONUs** pages, you can find tables with information related to these subjects.

The **Alarms** page shows a table listing all alarms. You can configure if cleared alarms should be displayed in this table or not. There are also two subpages:

- **Statistics:** Shows alarm statistics, such as the number of total critical/major/minor/warning alarms.
- **Shelf:** Contains the Shelved Alarms table.
