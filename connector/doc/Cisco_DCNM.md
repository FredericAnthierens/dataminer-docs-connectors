# Cisco DCNM

Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is a management system for the Cisco Programmable Fabric. In addition to provisioning, monitoring and troubleshooting the data center network infrastructure, the Cisco DCNM provides a comprehensive feature set that meets the routing, switching and storage administration needs of the data center. It streamlines the provisioning for the Programmable Fabric and monitors the SAN and LAN components.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination, by default *443*.

### Configuration of HTTP Authentication

The credentials of the device must be entered on the **General** page and then applied using the **Apply** button. This will generate a logon token that will be used for all future requests, or until the credentials are changed.

### Cisco DCNM API URL Configuration

The Cisco DCNM API URL for accessing flow status has changed in recent versions of DCNM. By default, this connector uses the "Old" URL. To use the new URL:

1. On the **General** page, select **Compose URLs**.

1. Enter your **Fabric Name** and **VRF Name**.

   The defaults are "Default_LAN" for Fabric, and "default" for the VRF.

1. Click **Set Flow Status**.

   The flow status table will now get populated.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The element created with this connector consists of the data pages detailed below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to poll fabric-related data (including Fabric Errors, Fabric Error History, Fabric Flows, and Host Policies), make sure **RTP Service Polling** is enabled on the RTP Services page.

### General

The **Username** and **Password** must be provided on this page. Every time the credentials have changed, you must press the **Apply** button to request a new authentication token.

### Inventory

This page displays a tree view of the inventory, showing a hierarchy of switches with their appropriate interfaces, modules and licenses.

The separate tables with the information on the **Switches**, **Modules**, **Licenses** and **Discovered Hosts** can be accessed via the page buttons at the bottom of the page.

### Flows

On this page, you can view and configure the general flow information in the **Flow Alias**, **Flow Policy** and **Flow Policy Multicast Ranges** tables.

You can access the tables with the status of the **Active**, **Inactive**, **Sender Only** and **Receiver Only** flows via the page buttons at the bottom of the page.

Note: Via the right-click menu, you can add or delete rows in the **Flow Alias**, **Flow Policy** and **Flow Policy Multicast Ranges** tables.

## Notes

**Warning**: Because of a change from version 1.0.0.3 onwards, the SLElement load will increase considerably, for example up to 1 Gb. The load depends on the number of records in the tables PTP Switch Corrections, RTP Error History and RTP Packet Drop History.
