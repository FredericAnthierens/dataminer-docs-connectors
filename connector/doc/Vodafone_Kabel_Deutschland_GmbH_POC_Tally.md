# Vodafone Kabel Deutschland GmbH POC Tally

## About

This is a dedicated connector intended to aggregate the SI system status of different lineups and systems.

The POC tally status is determined for each SI stream, so its status can be shown as *On-Air*, *Off-Air*, *On-Air Locally*, *Off-Air Locally*, *On-Air Locally Inverted*, or *Off-Air Locally Inverted*.

## Key Features

- **Status overview**: Aggregated status and individual status data is available per lineup, system, and site.
- **24/7 monitoring**: Constant monitoring to support continuous status updates.
- **Integrated endpoint**: The connector comes with an endpoint to retrieve the status data not only within DataMiner but also from external systems.

## Use Case

**Challenge**: The SI team needs a way to test, deploy, and monitor changes to their SI systems without causing outages.

**Solution**: The *On-Air* and *Off-Air* aggregated status indicates which systems can be used for testing, and the switching mechanisms provided in the connector allow users to activate or switch to a certain system.

**Benefit**: Improves uptime and reliability.
