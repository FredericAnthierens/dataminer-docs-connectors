DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Physical fixed interfaces:

- **IP Input FE**: Physical IP FE interface with type **in**.
- **IP Input GbE**: Physical IP GbE interface with type **in**.
- **ASI Input**: Physical ADI with interface with type **in**.
- **SDI Output**: Physical SDI interface with type **out**.
- **SDI Analog Audio Output**: Physical SDI with analog audio interface with type **out**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

Connections are made based on the parameters **Audio/Video Interface**, **Receive** and **Receive Interface** on the **Configuration** page.

The connections start from the selected input interface and go to both the **SDI Output** and the **SDI Analog Audio Output**. If **Receive** is **disabled**, no connections are made.
