# HW Group Temp-232

## About

The HW Group Temp-232 connector integrates DataMiner with the HW Group Temp-232 temperature sensor over a smart-serial link (auto‑report mode). It exposes a real-time temperature measurement with 0.1 °C resolution and supports alarm monitoring and trending.

## Key Features

- Smart-serial auto-report ingestion (no polling or commands required).
- Real-time temperature updates.
- Alarm monitoring based on parameter thresholds.
- Simple setup for direct RS-232 or serial-over-IP gateways.

## Use Case

**Challenge**: Monitor ambient temperature in technical rooms, racks, or enclosures from one central location.

**Solution**: Deploy the HW Group Temp-232 connector to monitor temperatures via DataMiner, and configure alarms on temperature limits to get notified automatically in case of issues.

**Benefit**: Early detection of thermal issues to prevent outages and enable faster incident response.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- DataMiner version 10.3.0.0 - 12752 or higher.
