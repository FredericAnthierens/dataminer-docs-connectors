## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

## How to use

This connector imports a CSV file that contains the list of IP addresses and status of STB boxes. It then displays this data in a table.

For this to work, you need to make sure that the CSV file is located in the correct location and specify the path.

The connector can also poll the data from an API that provides the necessary information about the STBs.
