# Skyline QAPortal

The **Skyline QAPortal** connector allows you to manage **regression tests**, group them together, and see the results in DataMiner. This way, you can also enable alarm monitoring and trending of the results of your regression tests.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

There is an option to push the results to the **Skyline QA Portal**. This will give **Skyline Communications** visibility on your test results. To enable this:

1. Make sure you have a [mail server configured](https://aka.dataminer.services/Configuring_outgoing_email) on your DMS, so the results can be mailed to the portal

1. Configure the **API Key** and the **Client ID** on the **Settings** page of the Skyline QAPortal element.

1. Enable the option **Forward Results to Portal**.

The API key and client ID will need to be provided by Skyline. The client ID defines your organization, and the API key is the secret that allows you to push results to the Skyline portal. Keep these **secret**, as otherwise anyone could push results in your name.

## How to Use

The connector will automatically detect any regression tests available in your DMS. Regression tests are added in the form of an Automation script.

If a regression test requires input parameters, you can add them on the **Input Parameters** page. The connector is designed so that you can add the same test multiple times with different inputs. This way, you can make your regression tests generic and reusable.

> [!TIP]
> To get you started with regression tests, an example script is available: [SLC-AS-SkylineQAPortalExampleTest](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-AS-SkylineQAPortalExampleTest).

### Adding a Regression Test

To add a regression test, go to the **General** page, right-click the **Regression Tests** table, and select **Add new test**.

If you have just added a new regression test, you may need to use the **Refresh Tests** button to see it in the dropdown box.

### Adding Input Parameters

If your regression test has input parameters, configure these in the **Input** column of the **Regression Tests** table.

If you have not yet defined any **input group** (i.e. the dropdown is empty), create a new input group:

1. After you have clicked the pencil icon in the **Input** column of the **Regression Tests** table, click **...**.

1. Select **New** and click the green check mark icon.

   This will create a new group **Input Group** in the **Input Parameters** table.

1. Go to the **General** > **Input Parameters** page.

1. Use the pencil icons in the **Value** column of the Input Parameters table to configure a value for the parameters in the group.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also use the right-click menu of the Input Parameters table to create or remove input groups.

### Grouping Your Tests

To group a set of tests so that you can execute them at once, use the **Group** column in the **Regression Tests** table.

If the tests need to be executed in a specific order, use the **Exec Order** column to define the order. The test that is lowest in the order will be executed first. If any tests in the same group have the same position in the order, they will be executed at the same time.

### Running Your Tests

You can run the regression tests by using the **Run** button in the **Regression Tests** table or in the **Groups** table.

Once the tests are finished, you will find the results on the **Results Cases** and the **Results Performance** pages.
