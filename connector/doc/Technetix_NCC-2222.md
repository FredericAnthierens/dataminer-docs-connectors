# Technetix NCC-2222

## About

An NCC-2222 chassis, as part of the Narrowcast Controller system, combines broadcast amplification with advanced controller functionality. It manages all connected NarrowCast inserters (NCI-521/WB or NCI-521-12, up to 22 units) while supporting dual broadcast input (A/B) for redundancy. With this connector, you will be able to monitor each connected unit via a separate child element in DataMiner.

## Key Features

- **Chassis integration**: Combines broadcast amplification and controller functionality for up to 22 NCI‑521 inserter units.
- **Redundant broadcast inputs**: Dual A/B inputs ensure uninterrupted service in case of a feed failure.
- **Per‑unit DVE elements**: Automatically creates a DataMiner element for each connected unit, enabling granular monitoring and control.
- **NCI overview**: Real‑time summary of all installed NCI‑521 cards and their status, including attenuation and equalization settings.
