# Hessischer Rundfunk ABR Audio Monitoring Service

The **ABR Audio Monitoring Service** connector is a customer-specific enhanced service protocol. When you create a service in DataMiner, you can use this service protocol to create an enhanced service that will monitor and aggregate the overall audio alarm status. The **Encoding Bitrate Status** and **Probe Download Status** are available as individual alarm status information in the service.

## Key Features

- **Channel monitoring**: Monitor the overall and combined alarm status of the audio channels and their bitrate profiles.

## Prerequisites

- To generate services based on this enhanced protocol, a **service template** will need to be added in the DMS.
