# Skyline Modulator Simulation Technical

## About

The Skyline Modulator Simulation connector emulates a real modulator, allowing users to adjust and monitor parameters for demonstration and training purposes without requiring physical hardware.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use

### General

The General page provides access to key modulator parameters, including mode, state, output frequency, carrier modulation, symbol rate, bit rate, and roll-off. These parameters can be both monitored and configured, enabling accurate simulation of modulator behavior.

### Location Details

The Location Details page allows you to define the modulator's geographical information, including the location name, latitude, and longitude, providing contextual details for simulation scenarios.
