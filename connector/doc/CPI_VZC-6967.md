## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial main connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **IP port**: The port of the connected device.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the connected device. (Between *48* and *111*.)

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information about the device, e.g. the **CMPA** **Model** and **Computer** **Information** **Version**. With the page buttons, you can also display extra information about the **Time** and **ALC**. The **Transmit** and **Reset to Defaults** buttons can be used to respectively transmit and reset the device.

### Amplifier

This page displays information about the amplifier. The **RF** **limits** are displayed and can also be enabled or disabled.

### Switch Infos

This page displays switch information. It shows whether the different switch settings are inhibited or not.

### Linearizer

This page displays the linearizer settings. It displays the state of the linearizer and several measurements. You can also configure certain linearizer settings on this page via the **Set Linearizer** page button.

Switch Controller

This page displays the switch controller status through **Mode, System, CIF Control and AMP Fault** and positions 1 to 4.

### Alarms

This page displays the alarms in the system. Via the **Alarm Config** page button, alarm thresholds can be configured.

### Web Interface
