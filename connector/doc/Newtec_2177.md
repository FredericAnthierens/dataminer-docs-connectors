# Newtec 2177

The Newtec 2177 is a variable-rate DVB satellite modulator. This connector can be used to monitor and control this device.

## About

The Newtec 2177 is the successor of the well-established NTC/2077. It has been designed for both DVB and Skyplex contribution and distribution, as well as for the telco and IP world. It can be used where high product flexibility is required for interfacing with other equipment. One of the main applications is the use on medium to high data rate DVB broadcast transmissions for distribution (QPSK) and contribution (QPSK + 8PSK + 16QAM) and for DVB-IP satellite backbones with existing IF upconverters (70-140 MHz) and HPAs.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Direct connection:
  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device.
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device.
  - **FlowControl**: FlowControl specified in the manual of the device.
- Interface connection:
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. (Default: *100*)

### Configuration

To ensure that the connector works correctly, make sure that the **RMCP version** on the device itself is set to **v2.0**. This can only be done via the web interface of the device.

## Usage

### Web Interface

This page displays the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.1.36.x** range of the **Newtec 2177** connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

Fixed interfaces

- **Input - DVB-SPI-LVDS IN** - A single fixed interface of type **input.**
- **Input** - **RS422-LVDS IN**  - A single fixed interface of type **input.**
- **Input** - **ASI-A IN**  - A single fixed interface of type **input.**
- **Input- ASI-B IN** - A single fixed interface of type **input.**
- **Output - Modulator Output OUT** - A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **Output - Monitoring Output OUT** - A single fixed interface of type **output**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Between \[**DVB-SPI-LVDS IN** -\> **Modulator Output OUT**\] and \[**DVB-SPI-LVDS IN** -\> **Monitoring Output OUT**\]
- Between \[**RS422-LVDS IN** -\> **Modulator Output OUT**\] and \[**RS422-LVDS IN** -\> **Monitoring Output OUT**\]
