## Configuration

### Connections

From connector range 4.0.0.x onwards, only an HTTP connection is used.

#### SNMP Connection (Prior to Range 4.0.0.x)

**SNMP Connection:**

- **IP Address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. 10.24.4.138

**SNMP Settings:**

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, default 161
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is public.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is private.

#### HTTP Connection

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination, e.g: http://10.24.4.138
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Initialization (Range 4.0.0.x)

To use this connector, on the **Security Settings** page, first set a **Username** and a **Password** to authenticate all HTTP sessions.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use - Ranges Prior to 4.0.0.x

This connector will create a DVE for each device attached to the main device.

### General Page

This page displays a table with the blades present on the device.

### Device Page (DVE)

This page will show general information about the device, e.g. **Device Name**, **Device State**, **Device Output URL**, etc.

### Service (DVE)

This page displays information regarding the service provided by this device, e.g. **Service Name**, **Service State**, etc.

### Blade (DVE)

This page shows information about the blade to which the device is connected, e.g. **Blade Name**, **Blade Serial Number**, etc.

## Usage - Range 4.0.0.x

From version 4.0.0.7 onwards, it is possible to export each service as a DVE. This can be configured on the **Services** page.

### General Page

This page displays general information about the device, e.g. Device Name, Firmware Version, CPU Load, Memory Usage, etc.

### SDI Cards Page

This page displays a table with SDI cards information (card name, status, FPGA ID, FPGA version, Board ID, Board version), as well as a table containing SDI inputs information (card name, input number, has signal, video format, mode).

### Services Page

This page displays the Services table. This table displays the service name, service status, streaming status, input information, and output. You can also stop, delete, or start a single service or all services.

From version 4.0.0.8 onwards, a **Manage** button is available for the services, which starts a wizard that allows you to configure some parameters for a service. The wizard uses the Automation script *Ateme_Titan_Live_Manage_Service*.

From version 4.0.0.2 onwards, you can change the format of the SDI input port name. For legacy reasons, this cannot be changed automatically. The old format is `sdi-card-x Input y`; the new format is `sdi-card-x/y`.

### Services Overview Page (Version 4.0.0.x or Higher)

This page contains a graphical overview of the transport stream structure, with the audio, video, and data streams.

### Services Output (Version 4.0.0.x or Higher)

This page contains the tables that are also shown in a tree control: **Services**, **Output Transport Streams**, **Output Audio Parameters**, **Output Video Parameters**, **Output Data Parameters**, and **Output Streams Interfaces**.

- The **Services** table contains information such as the **Status**, the **Streaming Status**, **Input Type**, **Output**, and **Video Format**.

- The **Output Transport Streams** table is an internal table that is only used to link a profile to the streams that are part of that profile.

- The **Output Audio Parameters** table contains information about each output audio stream, such as the **Codec**, the **Bitrate**, and the **Sample Rate**.

- The **Output Video Parameters** table contains information about each output video stream, such as the **Codec**, the **Bitrate**, and the **Framerate**.

- The **Output Data Parameters** table contains information about each output data stream, such as the **Codec**.

- The **Output Streams Interfaces** table contains information about each output stream interface, such as the **Output URL** and **Output Stream Interface**.

### Services Input (Version 4.0.0.x or Higher)

This page contains the tables that can be used to reconfigure the settings of the IP inputs services, including the Active Input, TS Smoothing, TS Sync Loss Failover and Timeout, and more.

### Hardware Monitoring Page

This page displays the CPU temperature, the power supply status, and a table with all the fan information.

### Main Services Status Page

This page displays a table with the status of all main services (NTP, SDI, syslog, VCA, SNMPD, etc.).

### Alarms Page

This page displays a table with alarms. With the Filter Alarms Status toggle button, you can switch between showing all alarms or only open alarms.

### System Configuration Page

On this page, you can configure the time, SNMP, and Syslog.

### Network Configuration Page

On this page, you can configure the device network. The page has four tables: Physical Interfaces, Routes, VLANs, and Statmux Pool.

### Alarms Configuration Page

On this page, you can configure the alarms.

### Security Settings

This page allows you to enter a username and password to authenticate all HTTP sessions. To be able to use all sets, you need to authenticate with the API user.

### Encoding Page (Version 4.0.0.8 or Higher)

This page displays the services available on the device, divided over the TS Services and Encoding Services tables.
