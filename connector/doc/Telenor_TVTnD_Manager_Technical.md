# Telenor TVTnD Manager

## About

In the Telenor DMS, the **Telenor TVTnD Manager** is in charge of customer devices diagnosis. Customer diagnosis input parameters are the customer ID, diagnosis period (start and end time), and response message language.

Diagnosis is performed on request. It is performed by the configurable DOM diagnosis configurations in the **TVTnD Manager Configurator** low-code app.

Results of the diagnosis are stored in three categories represented by tables:

- **Diagnosis Log**: Information about the diagnosis process, including the diagnosis time, the start and end times, the customer ID, the user or process that started the diagnosis, and the JSON response containing diagnosis results.
- **Diagnosis**: Linked with the diagnosis configurations, this table contains the diagnoses generated when the run for a specific diagnosis configuration results in a diagnosis for the device.
- **Detected Issue**: Table containing all detected issues, linked with the specific diagnosis run.

Diagnoses and detected issues aggregation by device class type is performed every 5 minutes. Diagnosis results are stored in tables dedicated for each device class type, while detected issues are stored in a single table with a device class type column.

These tables support further analysis and reporting.
