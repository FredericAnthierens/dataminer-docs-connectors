# Alcatel SR Manager

The **Alcatel-Lucent 7750 Service Router** is an industry-leading multi-service edge router designed for the concurrent delivery of advanced residential, business, and mobile services on a common IP edge platform.

This connector can be used to control and monitor the services via **SNMPv2**. The connector has a secondary SNMPv2 connection to provide **device redundancy**.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

From the **2.0.0.x** range of the Alcatel SR Manager connector onwards, the usage of DCF is supported. This can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

From the **2.0.10.x** range of the Alcatel SR Manager connector onwards, the minimum required DataMiner version is **10.3.0.0 - 12752**.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Fixed Interface

A single fixed interface named **Network Input** of type **input** is available.

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- For each **SAP Split Horizon Group** (for instance *SR Ingest*, *SR Outgest*, etc.), a virtual dynamic interface is created of type **inout**.
- For each SDP entry in the **SDP Info** table, a virtual dynamic interface is created in the **SDP Group** of type **inout.**
- For each entry in the **SDP Ingress Packets and Octets Monitoring** table, a virtual dynamic interface is created in **SDP Accounting** of type **inout**. Connections can be made from either SDP Ingress Packets and Octets Monitoring or SDP Egress Packets and Octets Monitoring, since the SDP bindings of both tables (16000 and 16100) are identical.

Physical dynamic interfaces:

- For each entry in the **TMNX Ports** table, a physical dynamic interface is created of type **inout**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Connections from the **Network Input** interface to all **SDPs** of which the operating state is up.

- **SDPid** connection property of type **generic** with the value of the **SDP ID**.

- Connections from the **SDP** interfaces to the **Split Horizon Groups** of the same **service** when both the SDP and the service are up.

- **SDPsrv** connection property of type **generic** with the value of the **SDP service**.

- Between all the **SAP Split Horizon Group Interfaces** within one and the same **service**, an internal connection is created with the following property:

- **IsSHG** connection property of type **generic** with the value **False**.

- In case a **TMXN Port** is related to a certain **SAP Split Horizon Group** of a **service** and in case the service, port and SAP are up, an internal connection is created with the following properties:

  - **IsSHG** connection property of type **generic** with the value **True** or **False**, depending on whether the SAP Split Horizon Group is a Split Horizon Group.
  - **VLAN** connection property of type **generic** with a value containing the ports **Vlan IDs**.
