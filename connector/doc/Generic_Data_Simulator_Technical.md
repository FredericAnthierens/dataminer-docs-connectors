# Generic Data Simulator

## About

This is a virtual connector that allows you to customize and mimic any kind of API or device interface by adding parameter simulations with various trending type possibilities.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use (1.0.0.X)

CPU load and NIC bitrate simulation can be customized on the **General** and **Interfaces** pages, respectively.

## How to use (2.0.0.X)

To add simulated parameters, use the right-click menu of the **Simulations** table. You can add static values and trended numeric values with various behaviors. Via the same right-click menu, you can also edit or delete simulators.

Via the right-click menus of the tables on the **Configuration** page, you can assign a measurement unit and groups to each simulator. These serve as a conceptual classification of simulators.
