# NetInsight Nimbra Vision

## About

The NetInsight Nimbra Vision DataMiner connector is designed to provide management and orchestration functionalities for Nimbra MSR networks. This allows DataMiner to act as an orchestrator of orchestrators, leveraging Vision's computational and routing algorithms while maintaining a comprehensive view of the infrastructure.

## Key Features

The DataMiner Nimbra Vision connector provides not only a comprehensive view of all active Nimbra MSR circuits (with easy filtering based on type, node and metadata), but it also simplifies the process of setting up a new ad hoc Nimbra MSR circuit. Users can simply choose a service type and a source and destination node, and then click connect. The system automatically computes and schedules the network paths in the background.

- **Schedule services**: Prepare and schedule a circuit for the future with auto-route path detection.
- **Monitoring**: Quick access to specific nodes to promptly assess their health, usage, and alarms.

## Use Case

- **Challenge**: Traditionally, device products have focused on managing their specific configurations, which makes it challenging for third-party platforms to integrate all features of each specific device product while providing and holistic view.
- **Solution**: This connector provides management and orchestration functionalities for Nimbra MSR networks. This allows DataMiner to act as an orchestrator of orchestrators, leveraging Vision's computational and routing algorithms while maintaining a comprehensive view of the infrastructure and enabling end-to-end service orchestration across the Nimbra network.
- **Benefit**: You get a fully integrated ecosystem that manages and monitors the lifecycle of your services on your Nimbra network.

## Technical info

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.3 or higher** is required for compatibility with the NetInsight Nimbra Vision connector.
