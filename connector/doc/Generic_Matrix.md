## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use

This connector contains a single page containing a matrix, along with options to define the number of inputs and outputs for the matrix. Crosspoints are set locally and saved when the element is restarted.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The 1.0.0.x range of the Generic Matrix connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

Virtual dynamic interfaces:

- The **Matrix** interface is of type inout and can be used to dynamically link inputs to outputs.
