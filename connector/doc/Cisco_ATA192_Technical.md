# Connector Technical Documentation â€“ CISCO ATA192

## About

The CISCO ATA192 connector is designed to facilitate real-time monitoring and management of Cisco ATA192 Analog Telephone Adapters via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). These adapters serve as a critical bridge between traditional analog telephony equipment and modern VoIP networks, converting analog voice signals into digital packets for transmission over IP-based infrastructures.

By leveraging SNMP communication, the connector collects a comprehensive set of network protocol statistics, providing visibility into key operational metrics and communication behaviors of the ATA192 device. The connector enables operators to proactively monitor network behavior, identify anomalies, and optimize the performance of voice services using the Cisco ATA192 device. This level of visibility is particularly beneficial in managed service environments, where early detection of issues can significantly reduce downtime and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the CISCO ATA192 device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: 161 (default)
- **Get community string**: *public*
- **Set community string**: *private*

### Web Interface

The CISCO ATA192 device includes a built-in web interface, accessible when the client machine is on the same network. It allows administrators to configure settings, networking features, and system parameters. You can access this web interface via this element.

## How to Use

Once the element has been created, the connector will begin polling the device for network protocol statistics via SNMP. These statistics are grouped in four major categories:

- **IP Protocol Statistics**: Packet forwarding, delivery, and fragmentation.
- **ICMP Statistics**: Message handling including unreachable and echo types.
- **TCP Statistics**: Connection states, errors, and retransmissions.
- **UDP Statistics**: Datagram counts and errors.

This information provides detailed insight into network communication performance and potential issues at the device level.
