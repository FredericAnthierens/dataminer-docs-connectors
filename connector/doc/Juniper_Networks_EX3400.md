## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).
- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default 161.

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product. Note that this interface should be enabled first on the device.

## How to use

Several important settings can be found on the **Configuration** page, which allow you to enable/disable the polling of several tables. Those tables, located on other pages of the connector, contain different functional information about the device.

There is also an import/export file feature available on the **Operating States** page. **Import** makes it possible to set described data from the file into the desired table. Via **export** you can create a file that contains all the table data. Before you can execute an **import** or **export**, you first need to fill in the **file name** and the **file path**.

On the **Virtual Chassis** page, beneath **Chassis**, you can find the **software version** of the device, which can be useful to know in some cases.
