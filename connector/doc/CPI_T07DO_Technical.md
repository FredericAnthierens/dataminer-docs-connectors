# CPI T07DO

## About

The **CPI T07DO** connector allows DataMiner to monitor and control the **CPI T07DO** outdoor travelling-wave-tube amplifier (TWTA).  
This amplifier delivers **750 W of output power** for DBS-band satellite uplinks (17.3 â€“ 18.4 GHz) and is designed for reliable operation in harsh outdoor conditions.

The connector communicates with the device using **serial commands** as described in the CPI protocol manual.  
It provides operators with full access to device health, alarms, and key performance parameters, enabling proactive maintenance and efficient uplink management.

For product specifications, see the [CPI T07DO datasheet](https://www.cpii.com/docs/datasheets/818/t07do_mkt282.pdf).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **Type of Port**: TCP/IP
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *50000*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, by default *48*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element has the following data pages:

- **General**: Displays general information about the device. Via the **Set Time** page button, you can set the **Amplifier** **Name and** the **Time** of the device.
- **Amplifier Status**: Allows you to visualize several measurement points related to the amplifier and configure some important features on the device.
- **Switch Controller**: Displays information related to the switch controller. You can also change the switch controller settings here.
- **Set Points**: Use this page to set the fault and alarm trip points. Use the **Limits** page button to check the limits of the device before an alarm or fault is triggered.
- **System Status**: Allows you to check any fault on the device.
- **Alarm**: Displays the active alarms.
- **Log**: Allows you to log entries from the device. To do so, first set the **Log Entry Number To Get** and then the **Log Entry Units To Get**. Click **Get Entry** to send the command to the device. If you retrieve the same entry number but with different units, this will overwrite the row with the same entry number.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.2.0.x** connector range of the CPI T07DO connector supports the usage of DCF.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).
