# Work Satcom Remote Control Unit

## About

The Work Satcom Remote Control Unit connector integrates Work Satcom controllers with DataMiner. It enables operators to monitor and control up to eight converters via a single controller interface, making satellite operations more reliable and efficient.

## Key Benefits

- **Clear system visibility**: Instantly see the overall controller status, network details, and system limits to ensure smooth operations.

- **Simplified converter management**: Easily assign addresses to channels, view per-unit health, and keep all converters aligned and under control.

- **Reliable uplink during changing conditions**: Take advantage of Uplink Power Control (UPC) features such as calibration, fade detection, and automatic power adjustment to maintain stable communication even in adverse weather.

- **Proactive alarm notifications**: The connector automatically generates alarms for abnormal conditions, helping teams respond quickly and prevent service impact.

## Use Cases

### Multi-Converter Supervision

Monitor the controller and all converters from one place. Track alarms, frequency, power, and mute states in a single view to quickly identify and address issues.

### Weather Fade Compensation

Use UPC features to automatically adapt uplink power when fades occur, ensuring service reliability during difficult weather conditions.

### Safe Operations and Addressing

Easily configure unit addresses and rely on alarms for unconfigured addresses, warmup states, or communication issues to avoid misrouting and unsafe transmissions.

## Requirements

- DataMiner 10.3.0 or higher.
