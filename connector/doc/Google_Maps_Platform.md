# Google Maps Platform

## About

The Google Maps Platform is a collection of location-based services provided by Google that allows organizations to integrate Google Maps functionalities into their system.

This **Google Maps Platform connector** interacts with the Google Maps Platform API to collect environmental and route data for smart-city applications.

## Key Features

- **Air quality**: Provide air quality data and insights that help people reduce their exposure to pollution.
- **Pollen**: Give allergy sufferers information to help manage their pollen exposure.
- **Routes**: Get the duration and distance of a given route.

## Use Cases

### Air Quality

**Challenge**: One of the growing needs in health, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and travel is accessing real-time and localized air quality data.

**Solution**: Provides current AQI (Air Quality Index) levels at a specific location. It highlights the main pollutant for that specific location with the additional list of pollutants and their concentration level in that area. It also provides health recommendation for the different category of the population.

**Benefit**: Helps users make informed decisions, such as avoiding outdoor activities when there is poor air quality, and adjusting indoor air filters for smart home systems based on outdoor air quality.

### Pollen

**Challenge**: Getting real-time, localized, and detailed pollen data for allergy management and environmental awareness.

**Solution**: Provides current pollen conditions for a specific location including pollen levels/index for specific plant types (grass, trees, weeds). It also provides detailed information about the major allergenic species (e.g. alder, birch, oak, etc.).

**Benefit**: Helps users avoid high-exposure areas and helps to understand which specific plants are triggering allergies.
