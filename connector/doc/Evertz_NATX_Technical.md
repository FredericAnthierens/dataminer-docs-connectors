## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses two Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connections. To facilitate network redundancy, the device's two IP interfaces should be filled in during element creation. Starting from the 1.0.1.x range, an additional HTTP connection is used to retrieve data from the API.

#### SNMP Connection - Main

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### SNMP Connection - Backup

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### HTTP Connection - NATX API

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector displays only read-only information. The following data pages are available:

- **General**: Displays general information of the connector and its status.
- **Faults**: Displays alarm status parameters raised on a device level.
- **Ports**: Displays the port status as well as various alarm statuses associated with the ports of the device.
- **PTP**: Displays the status of the PTP, ports, and its masters.
- **Web interface**: Web GUI of the Evertz NATX device.
