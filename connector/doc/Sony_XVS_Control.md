## Configuration

### Connections

#### TCP Connection - Tally Protocol

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SMART-SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *2021*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

### Initialization

No additional configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

### M/E Xpoints

You can set crosspoints in a matrix control. The information about the destinations and sources is also displayed in separate tables. With the destinations table, you can change the connected input by setting a different source number.

### Bus Key States

Each individual state is displayed.

### Snapshots and Macro Control

This information is displayed in tables where you can manage presets of different kinds, which function in similar ways.

You can **add a preset** using the page button at the top of each table. Before saving the preset in the table, you can check if the preset works by clicking **Test Exec**. Feedback of the operation is provided in the UI.

You can **edit an existing preset** by right-clicking it in the table and selecting **Copy to Editor**. A pop-up message with further instructions will be displayed. After you have clicked Copy to Editor, use the above-mentioned preset page button to edit the preset instead of adding it. Note that changing the preset name is not supported through this workflow. If you change the name, a new preset will be added instead. You can only edit a preset name by changing it directly in the table. Duplicate names are not allowed.
