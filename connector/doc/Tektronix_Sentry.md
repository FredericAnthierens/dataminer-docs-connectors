# Tektronix Sentry

## About

This connector will display information about a Sentry device, including details related to ports, transport, and services. Alarm monitoring and trending are possible for some of the parameters in the connector, e.g. the bitrate.

## Key Features

- **Device information**: Quickly see details related to your Sentry device.
- **Monitoring**: Track important parameters such as bitrate, and receive alerts if something needs your attention.
- **Trends**: Observe how certain values change over time to help with troubleshooting and planning.
- **Automatic real-time updates**: The connector listens for SNMP traps, triggering instant updates when events occur on the device.

## Use Cases

### Monitoring Bitrate to Ensure Stable Broadcast Quality

- **Challenge**: Operators need to ensure that the bitrate of services remains stable to maintain broadcast quality among multiple Sentries. Unexpected drops can go unnoticed until they impact viewers.
- **Solution**: The Tektronix Sentry connector continuously monitors bitrate values and triggers alarms when values fall outside predefined thresholds.
- **Benefit**: Issues are detected early, allowing for quick intervention before service quality is affected.

### Quickly Pinpointing the Root Cause of Issues

- **Challenge**: When a service interruption occurs, it can be difficult to pinpoint the root cause without detailed device data.
- **Solution**: The connector provides access to historical trends and alarm logs, making it easier to trace back to the moment and cause of an interruption.
- **Benefit**: Troubleshooting is faster and more effective, reducing downtime and improving service reliability.

### Instant Notifications of Critical Changes

- **Challenge**: Important device events may be missed if operators rely solely on manual checks or periodic polling.
- **Solution**: The connector listens for SNMP traps, providing automatic notifications when significant events occur.
- **Benefit**: Operators are immediately informed of critical changes, enabling rapid responses to potential issues.

## Prerequisites

This connector requires the **.NET Framework 4.0**.
