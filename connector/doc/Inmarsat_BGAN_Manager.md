## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

The credentials must be filled in on the General page in order for any information to be polled. As long as this is not done, the element will not work. The credentials list is as follows:

- Scope
- Client ID
- Client Secret

The default scope, client ID, and secret can be found in the Rest API documentation. However, they will be configurable in the network.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use (1.1.0.x)

### General

Credentials can be configured on this page, and a login can be enforced. There is also information on the current status of the authentication process.

### Customers

This page displays generic information for all customers currently accessible from the configured user.

### Terminal

This page contains a Terminals table as well as buttons to subpages: Data Sessions, Operator Network Status, Geo Fence, and Status Report.

- The **Data Sessions** subpage displays the running, completed, and failed data sessions of the terminals.
- The Operator **Network Status** subpage displays the operator network status of the terminals.
- The **Geo Fence** subpage displays geo fence information for the terminals.
- The **Status Report** subpage contains the status report for the terminals.

### Terminal Tree Control

This page contains a tree control that links the terminal data together.

### Hybrid Terminal

This page contains the Hybrid Pairs table, Hybrid Prism table, and Hybrid Terminals table, as well as buttons to subpages: Hybrid Data Sessions, Hybrid Operator Network Status, Hybrid Geo Fence, and Hybrid Status Report.

- The **Hybrid Data Sessions** subpage contains the running, completed, and failed data sessions of the hybrid terminals.
- The **Hybrid Operator Network Status** subpage displays the operator network status of the hybrid terminals.
- The **Hybrid Geo Fence** subpage displays geo fence information for the hybrid terminals.
- The **Hybrid Status Report** subpage contains the status report for the hybrid terminals.

### Hybrid Terminal Tree Control

This page contains a tree control that links the hybrid terminal data together.

### Events

This page displays the events for all non-hybrid and hybrid terminals.

### Poll Manager

This page contains the Polling Manager table, which manages the polling of the API calls with individual timers. It also shows the time when the API call was last polled.

## Notes

- **1.0.0.x**: **Terminal detail data** is obtained **per terminal**. This means that in **larger networks** this set of operations will become **slower**. The larger the network, the longer it will take to obtain all the terminal data.
- **1.1.0.x**: **Terminal data** is retrieved through a **single API call**.
