# Precise Time and Frequency 1226

## About

This connector is designed to interface with the Precise Time and Frequency 1226 system, enabling users to access and manage its high-stability time and frequency signals. Through SNMP and Telnet protocols, the connector supports monitoring and configuration of device parameters, ensuring precise synchronization and dependable performance for critical applications.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive operational status monitoring**: Provides real-time visibility on the status of all outputs, inputs, and auxiliary channels. Users can quickly identify channel conditions to ensure system reliability and reduce downtime.

- **Configurable channel control**: Supports direct configuration of channels from within DataMiner. Operators can activate or inactivate specific outputs, inputs, or auxiliary channels as required, enabling flexible system management and streamlined troubleshooting.

- **Voltage supervision across all channels**: Continuously monitors the voltage levels of outputs, inputs, and auxiliary channels. This ensures stable performance, helps detect anomalies early, and supports proactive maintenance to maintain signal accuracy and system integrity.

- **Fault detection and alerts**: Alarms triggered for abnormal conditions, such as channel faults or voltage irregularities, enable faster incident response and minimize system disruption.
