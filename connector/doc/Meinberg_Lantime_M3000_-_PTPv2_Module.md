## How to use

A DVE child element is created for each row in the **PTP** table unless the port status for that particular module is either *Disabled* or *Deleted*. All columns from the element running the **Meinberg Lantime M3000** connector are exported as single parameters to the subpage corresponding with the table name (e.g. the columns from the **Basic Networking table** in the parent connector are exported to the **Basic Networking page** in the child element).

DCF connections are exported to the child element as a physical dynamic interface.
