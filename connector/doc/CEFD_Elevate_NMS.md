# CEFD Elevate NMS

## About

The CEFD Elevate NMS connector enables comprehensive monitoring and management of CEFD's ELEVATE VSAT network infrastructure via HTTP APIs delivering JSON data.

Built for scalable VSAT deployments, the connector offers visibility into a wide range of network elements including inroute and outroute controllers, Virtual Network Operators (VNOs), stations, and overall network performance. It supports monitoring of MF-TDMA and H-DNA waveforms, enabling dynamic adaptation and efficient satellite bandwidth management.

## Key Features

- **Monitoring of networks**: Obtain an overview of all managed VSAT networks, with visibility on network availability, operational status, and key performance metrics. This allows quick identification of network-wide issues and provides a baseline for detailed analysis of individual network components.

- **Monitoring of inroute controllers**: Gain detailed insights into inroute controller status and performance. Monitor key metrics such as detected faults, modulation and coding (Modcods) schemes, TDMA load distribution, and ACM (Adaptive Coding and Modulation) activity to ensure optimal upstream link health.

- **Monitoring of outroute controllers**: Track outroute controllers with granular visibility into their performance metrics, detected faults, modulation and coding details, and ACM configurations. This allows effective management of downstream transmission quality and reliability.

- **VNOs overview and performance data**: View a consolidated summary of all Virtual Network Operators (VNOs), including key status indicators, active session counts, and general health metrics. Dive deeper with detailed performance data showing traffic load, throughput, error rates, and trends, enabling efficient service management and troubleshooting.

- **Station monitoring**: Monitor station-level metrics with detailed fault detection and TDMA-related operational data. This comprehensive view assists in maintaining station health and optimizing bandwidth utilization.

## Use Case: Centralized Monitoring and Performance Management of VSAT Networks

An organization managing a distributed VSAT network requires real-time monitoring of satellite links, controllers, and virtual network operators to maintain high availability and service quality. Challenges include detecting faults promptly, managing dynamic bandwidth allocation, and optimizing network performance across geographically dispersed sites.

By deploying the CDEF Elevate NMS connector within DataMiner, network operators gain **centralized access to comprehensive telemetry data** from all critical network components. They can **track inroute and outroute controller health**, observe **VNO traffic and performance trends**, and **manage station status and faults** effectively. The connectorâ€™s integration supports **adaptive modulation schemes and TDMA load balancing**, improving link reliability and throughput. With historical data and real-time alerts, the team can **proactively address issues**, optimize capacity, and ensure seamless satellite communications across their network.
