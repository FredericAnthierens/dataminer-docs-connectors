# AppearTV X20 Platform

The AppearTV X20 Platform connector can be used to configure and display information from an AppearTV X Platform chassis. This includes both X20 and X10 chassis versions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For new greenfield deployments, we strongly recommend using the successor of this connector, which is available as **[Appear X platform](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/ea164cd4-c408-4fe6-9506-087d868aee79)** in the DataMiner Catalog. The current **AppearTV X20 Platform** connector is still maintained, but in the future it will be fully replaced by the new **Appear X Platform**.

On the US market, the same chassis is also offered by Sencore. Under the Sencore brand, it is offered with the following model names: **Sencore DMG-3200** (X10 Chassis), **Sencore DMG-4100**, and **Sencore DMG-4200** (X20 Chassis).

It allows manual creation of DVEs for **IP Switch**, **Dual IP**, **SDI IO, Encoder, Decoder, Transcoder, DVB, Descrambler**, and **Scrambler** cards connected to the slots of the device (see "Exported Connectors" table below).

The connector uses an **HTTP** connection. This connection uses the MMI, IpGateway, XGER, ASI, and SDI APIs to retrieve information and to configure the device. The information transfer is performed using JSON.
The connector **sequentially** requests information from the device, processes the responses and displays the results. It is possible to send configuration requests and receive the updated results.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The port of the connected device, by default 443 (*4949).*
- **Bus address**: By default *bypassproxy.*

In case of communication issues (ERROR_WINHTTP_TIMEOUT), check the used TLS version in Wireshark. If it is TLS 1.0, download and install the "Easy fix" from the page [*https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3140245/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-wi*](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3140245/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-wi), and reboot the server.

#### SNMP Secondary Connection.

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

### Configurable API Versions

From version 1.2.0.28 onwards, it is possible to configure a higher API version for specific cards. To do so, go to the **General** \> **Module Config** page.

Increasing the API version will result in extra data being filled in if that API version is supported on the chassis.

## Usage - Versions 1.2.0.x/1.2.1.x/1.2.2.x/1.2.3.x/1.2.4.x/2.0.0.x/2.0.1.x/2.0.2.x/2.0.3.x

### General

This page displays the **Chassis Cards Table**, which contains one row per card in the chassis, detailing **Serial**, **Name**, **Hardware**, **Software**, **Slot**, **Features**, **Licenses**, and **State** information.
