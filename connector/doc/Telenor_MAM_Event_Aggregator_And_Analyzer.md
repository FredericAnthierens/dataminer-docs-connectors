# Telenor MAM Event Aggregator And Analyzer

## About

The **Telenor MAM Event Aggregator and Analyzer** connector queries an OpenSearch database for MAM error events offloaded by the **Telenor EPM MAM Offloader**. It supports a configurable aggregation period and provides two key aggregations: one by **Device Class Type** and another by **Asset ID**.

This enables effective trending and alerting based on MAM error event counts, helping to identify issues with specific devices or assets in the field.

## Key Features

- **Error statistics from offloaded data**: Easily analyze error trends over time and identify periods with elevated error counts.

- **Customizable aggregation period**: Adjust the aggregation window to test different configurations and optimize results.
