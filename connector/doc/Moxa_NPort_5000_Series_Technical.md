# Moxa NPort 5000 Series Connector

## About

The Moxa NPort 5000 Series connector is designed to interface with the Moxa NPort device. It collects and visualizes comprehensive system, network, and serial communication metrics via SNMP, while also enabling device control features such as soft reset via Telnet.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the Moxa NPort device.
- **Device address**: Not required.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: 161 (default).

#### Telnet Connection â€“ Moxa Telnet

This connector uses a Telnet connection to perform soft reset commands.

TELNET CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: Not required.
- **Device address**: Not required.
- **Port number**: Not required. (The connector uses the default telnet port: 23).

> [!NOTE]
> Telnet is only used to perform soft resets, not for polling data.

## How to Use

In the element, the SNMP parameters polled by the connector are shown on different data pages:

- **General**: System description, object ID, uptime, contact, name, location, number of services.
- **Interfaces**: Physical and virtual interface statistics.
- **Network**: Datagram, address translation, and discard statistics.
- **TCP**: Table of all active TCP connections and session-level metrics.
- **UDP**: UDP datagram counters, errors, and traffic stats.
- **Network Translation**: The Address Translation tables show which network address corresponds with which physical address.
- **ICMP**: ICMP-related metrics like echo requests and responses.
- **Serial Settings**: RS-232 port information including synchronous/asynchronous port status.
- **Signal**: Input and output signal tables for RS-232 lines.
- **SNMP**: SNMP message statistics such as get, set, and trap counters.

Telnet connectivity enables remote soft resets, useful for troubleshooting or recovering unresponsive devices.

## Notes

- This connector supports standard MIBs provided by Moxa. Ensure the correct firmware version and SNMP agent are enabled on the device.
- The Telnet-based soft reset functionality must be explicitly enabled and accessible via the device configuration.
