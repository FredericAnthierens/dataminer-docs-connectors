# Chatsworth Products Switched eConnect PDU

## About

Switched eConnect PDUs provide remote monitoring of power at the rack level as well as individual outlet control, making it possible to remotely turn power on or off at each outlet. They are designed for advanced data center power management and can be controlled remotely via web or SNMP to turn individual outlets on/off or reboot devices. This connector functions as a monitoring tool of the Switched eConnect PDU. It monitors information such as the PDU branch, outlets, and sensors.

## Key Features

- **Outlet monitoring and configuration**: Monitor and alarm important KPIs for the outlets on the PDU and remotely control the power and the reset delay times.

- **Door monitoring and configuration**: Monitor and alarm the door status and configuration indicators, and configure lock times and open times for a door.

- **Sensor status monitoring**: Monitor the temperature and humidity of specific sensors.

- **PDU branch monitoring**: Monitor the status of different branches in the PDU (e.g. voltage, current, power).

## Use Cases

### Perâ€‘Outlet Monitoring

**Challenge**: Monitoring all outlets form a single location.

**Solution**: DataMiner provides precise tracking of voltage, current, power usage, and power factor for each device or circuit.

**Benefit**: Load balancing and efficiency calculations.

### Environmental and Sensor Monitoring

**Challenge**: Monitoring sensor status values form a single source.

**Solution**: DataMiner provides a simple and clean overview of the temperature and humidity values for each probe.

**Benefit**: Monitoring environmental conditions at rack level helps maintain ASHRAE-recommended conditions without overcooling and helps conserve energy.
