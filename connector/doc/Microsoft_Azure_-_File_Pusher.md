# Microsoft Azure - File Pusher

## About

**Azure File Pusher** is used to enable periodic or manually triggered uploads of local files to Azure Blob Storage, where their content can be used for further analysis or online access. It helps automate file synchronization from local storage to Azure Blob Storage in an easy and intuitive way.

Credentials for authentication are securely stored within the collector and used every time files are uploaded.

As a safety measure to prevent file uploads from getting stuck, you can configure the number of failures or the duration after which the upload will be terminated on the configuration page.

You can configure multiple file path combinations, each with dedicated upload settings, allowing flexible file transfers to the Azure Blob Storage that best fits your use case.

> [!TIP]
> For a better user experience, this connector can be used together with the [**Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform**](xref:Connector_help_Microsoft_Azure) connector, which allows you to monitor relevant resource metrics available in Azure.
