## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **General** page displays general system information for the device.

The **Status** page contains several parameters that monitor the device state, such as Forward and Reflected Power, internal voltage values, and temperatures.

On the **Control** page, control options are provided for several parameters for the device power amplification (for example: Attenuation, State, Control Mode).

The **RF Setup** page provides alarm and fault threshold parameters for Minimum and Maximum Forward Power and the Forward Power Offset. Thresholds can be set for these parameters.

The **Redundancy** page shows which Block Upconverter Unit is online or in standby mode.

On the **Beacon Rx** page, parameters related to the Beacon Rx component can be viewed and configured.

The **Fault** page contains the fault detection configuration, along with flag parameters.

The **Web Interface** page displays the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
